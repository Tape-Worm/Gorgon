# Introduction

>Thank you for considering contributing to Gorgon. 

>Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### What we would like from you as a contributer

* Constructive criticism - with reasonable suggestions as solutions.
* Bug fixes
* Addtional functionality that extends the API.
* Example code
* Tutorials
* Documentation
* Localization

### What we don't want

* A full game engine - Unity, Xenko, Unreal, etc... already exist to serve this purpose. Use those instead if Gorgon is not to your liking.
* Additional APIs that don't make sense (e.g. a database API) to bundle with Gorgon.
* Code from other sources without proper attribution - Don't steal other peoples work.
* Code from other sources without proper modification to integrate with Gorgon.
* Code that is CPU specific (i.e. it must be AnyCPU or capable of running as AnyCPU)
* Code must not require a convoluted set of dependencies.
* Code **must** compile. If it does not, it will be rejected.
* Binaries that don't use some variant of open source.
* Code that is not public domain, or open source (must be compatible with MIT). 
* Assets that are not available for public redistribution (e.g. anything protected under copyright laws).
* Full blown games.

# Ground Rules

* Your code should follow the style (as much as possible) present in the Gorgon code case.  
* Commenting/documentation is a must. Your code **will** be rejected otherwise.
* Your code should try to be clear and concise.
* Don't bring self righteous criticism of others code - Remember: You aren't as smart as you think you are.  And no, "tough love" critiques are not exempt from this - that's still being a jerk.
* If you have Resharper, ensure that you use the resharper settings included with Gorgon, deviations in style are fine, but only to a point. If style deviates too much, the code will be rejected.
