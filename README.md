What is Gorgon?
===============

A 2D graphics library for .NET and SlimDX.  Also, it’s proof that I can’t do 3D.

=What’s the licensing? What did you do to my soul?=
Versions 1.1.x and up of Gorgon are licensed under the MIT license.
Your soul is a lie.

=How far along are you?  Is it done yet?  How about now?=
Gorgon is complete, released and in version 1.1.x.

_Version 2.0 is currently being developed which will support Direct 3D 11._

=What can it do?=
Oh sweet jeebus, what can’t it do?  It can slice, dice, puree, and even solve pi to 3,899,122,129,991,211,100 decimal places.  It rules.  Really, it does.  It’s better than Half Life 2 because I say it is.

That said, it:
  * Supports pixel/vertex shaders.
  * Supports stencil buffers.
  * Supports png, jpg, bmp, etc.. image formats.
  * Runs pretty swift.  Can dump well over 10,000 sprites to the screen and still get >=30 FPS.
  * Supports render targets.
  * Supports drawing to various surfaces (i.e. lines, points, circles, ellipses, etc…).
  * Supports virtual file systems for packed files and folder mounting.
  * Has a plug-in architecture, so you can extend it indefinitely.
  * Has a nifty keen animation system.
  * Fonts!  Bitmap fonts.  Flexible bitmap fonts even.
  * Has support for raw input from input devices.  Even has rudimentary joystick support.
  * Can render into any type of windows control, e.g. a panel, form, textbox (yes, textbox.  No, I don’t know why you’d want that).
  * I’m sure there’s more, but I’m too lazy to look it up.

Yeah, it’s pretty metal.

=What do I need to make all my dreams come true?=
Your dreams mean nothing, and are ultimately futile.  Anyway, you’ll require the following:
  * [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=ab99342f-5d1a-413d-8319-81da479ab0d7 .NET 3.5 SP1]

  * [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyId=2DA43D38-DB71-4C1B-BC6A-9B6652CD92A3&displaylang=en Microsoft DirectX 9] (installed by the SlimDX installer which is installed by Gorgon)

=== To compile the library ===
  * [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/vstudio/ Visual C# 2010] to compile the library. If you're tight on funds and don't have a kidney to sell so you can put a down payment on Visual Studio, you can always opt for the [http://www.microsoft.com/express/ FREE Express editions].  This is only to compile the library, to use the library Visual Studio 2008 will work as well.

=== To use the library ===
  * You may use any .NET 3.5 enabled language to write an application with Gorgon.

= Source code =
Source code is included with the installer, however if you want to get the latest and not so greatest version of the source, you may go to the [http://code.google.com/p/gorgonlib/source/checkout SVN repository for Gorgon] (see the Source tab up there?  Yeah, click that).
