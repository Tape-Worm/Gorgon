December 3/2008 - Version - Current
===============================================================================================
* Worked around a bug with older Intel drivers where the bound vertex buffer is not updated
  after the initial changes to the vertex buffer.  The workaround requires that SetStreamSource
  be called during every frame.  This is a minor perfomance hit, but it will only affect Intel
  cards.
  
* Updated a bug in the FileSystemPath object where GetFiles() was getting ALL files in the file
  system instead of just the files belonging to the path and its children.
  
* Updated FileSystemEditor to have the ability to copy files from a virtual file system back
  on to the external windows file system (Copy file/path to external folder).
  
- Removed the default frame #0 that was inserted when an empty track was selected.  The system
  will now just use whatever default the sprite originally had an leave the track empty.  This
  was problematic at times, and somewhat confusing.  Now if you want to start an animation, 
  the user will have to set up the initial frame manually (by adding the frame via the add key
  button or pressing enter on the dialog boxes or if the property can be dragged like Position
  or Axis).
  
* Modified draggable properties to now show a hand icon to indicate dragging ability when the
  mouse is moved over the object to be dragged.

+ Added ability to drag the axis in the animation editor.  You can do it in the main sprite
  display, why not in the editor too?

* Modified EditorCanDragAttribute to now take/return a DragType as opposed to TRUE or FALSE.  
  This allows for various types of dragging to be possible.

* Updated an issue with the Sprite Editor where the sprite would appear offscreen when its axis
  was set to the right/lower portion of the sprite.  While technically correct, this made the
  UI a little more difficult to use.  The sprite will now appear in the center of the screen
  -UNLESS- the position track has keys (and the frame #0 position is not the center of the
  screen).

November 20/2008 - Version 1.1.3246.24958
===============================================================================================
* Modified the GorgonInput plug-in.  There is platform specific native code that will mess up
  on x64 systems.  This used to be handled via conditional compilation, but since we now have
  a unified project file, we needed another solution.
  
- Removed the x64 .sln and .csproj files.  Since the SlimDX runtime installer will put SlimDX
  into the GAC (both x64 and x86), there's no need to have seperate files.  The projects are
  set to AnyCPU and will produce platform agnostic (MSIL) versions of the binaries.  The 
  .NET runtime is not responsible for determining which platform version of SlimDX to use.
  Note:  If you require that your application be strictly x64 or x86, all you need to do is
  set the platform in the properties of your project to whatever platform you require.  Your
  binary will force the usage of the proper platform version of SlimDX.

- Removed SlimDX from the Dependencies directory.  The installer will now install the SlimDX
  runtime and it will install any pre-requisites (except the .NET framework).
  
* Updated to the November 2008 version of SlimDX and DirectX.

+ Added sample that performs per pixel Dot3 bump mapping - BumpInTheNight.

+ Added a new function to the framework - bool OnValidateDriver(driver).  This will allow the
  user to accept or reject the current driver based on whatever criteria they choose.
  
* Fixed an issue with blitting images/renderimages where once the blitted image is stretched, it
  stays stretched even when calling Blit(x, y);.
  
* Fixed an issue where inverse source alpha blending caps were being reported incorrectly.

* Updated other shader parameters to check for NULL values when passing an image to a shader.

* Fixed an issue in the SetValue(Color[]) constant shader parameter.  The array was not being
  persisted to the shader.
  
* Fixed a bug in the FX shader parameters where a color value was being passed in directly to
  the shader via SetValue(Drawing.Color).  This was incorrect, the value should have been a
  SlimDX.Color4 value.  This had the effect of messing up any color values passed to the
  shader.  Also fixed the constant shader parameters where color values were not being
  translated correctly.
  
* Modified x64 framework project file.  Debug output directory was incorrect.

* Updated a bug in the SpriteMesh object where rotating the mesh caused the mesh to become
  skewed.  This was because the rotation code tried to rotate on the y axis with an already
  transformed x axis.  The correct thing to do was to rotate both axes as untransformed.
  i.e. I'm dumb.
  
* Updated issue with Renderable base class where the Axis property was being initialized with
  1, 1 instead of 0, 0.

October 29/2008 - Version - 1.1.0.0
===============================================================================================
* Updated FolderFileSystemOfPower example to display the same help text that's in the
  bzip filesystem version.
  
- Removed Delete() and DeletePath() functions from the file system object, they
  serve no purpose.

* The file system will store this purge flag per file system.  This requires a change
  to the file system index file and changes the header value from GORFS1.0 to GORFS1.1.
  As a consequence v1.0.x of Gorgon will not be able to read GORFS1.1 filesystems.
  However v1.1.x of Gorgon will read GORFS1.0 and GORFS1.1 just fine.

+ Added a Purge button to folder file system windows in the file system editor.
  When checked this will tell the file system to purge any deleted files and/or
  paths from the actual file system.  Otherwise it will be up to the user to clean
  up any left over files/paths after delete.  This will not appear for packed
  filesystems.

+ Added a PurgeDeletedFiles property to the FileSystem object.  This allows the 
  more paranoid user to handle the file system deletes themselves.  This only
  works on folder file systems.  Packed file systems will purge deleted data
  regardless of this.

+ Added two new protected functions to the file system object:
  OnPathDelete and OnFileDelete.
  These functions are called when a file is deleted from the filesystem.  These
  functions can be overridden by the file system type to perform specific
  actions when a file or path is deleted.  This will allow folder file systems
  to actually update the real file system when an item is deleted.

* Making small optimizations to the rendering code.

* Fixed an issue where having a non-null CurrentShader would cause a null
  reference exception when Gorgon.Terminate() is called.
  
* Fixed a problem when compiling shaders.  Shader errors were not being thrown
  as exceptions.

* Updated the mouse interface to correct some issues with the mouse cursor
  not showing when it had exclusive mode enabled/disabled.

* Updated NoCleverName example.  Animations were not playing.

* Modified mouse to reshow the cursor when the mouse object is destroyed.

* Modified input device objects to expose values via properties instead of direct
  values.
 
* Modified GorgonException.  There was an issue where the exception wasn't sending
  as much information in certain circumstances as it should have.  This has been
  corrected.

+ Added an example to show off the sprite mesh functionality (freshly ripped off
  from HGE).
  
+ Added an example to show off the minimal GUI functionality.

- Removed the Empty property on the TimingData object, it served no useful
  purpose.
  
* Changed the access modifier on the refresh/reset methods on the TimingData 
  object to internal, these functions have no real purpose being exposed as public 
  members.

* Unified all exception objects into a single exception type:
  GorgonException.  This exception system is modelled after SlimDX's ResultCode
  setup.  This was done to cut down on the amount of exception object clutter
  in the library.  GorgonExceptions will now contain packaged error information
  value types (GorgonError).  This will contain a code and description of the error
  and can be used to determine a course of action depending on the code packaged
  with the exception.  This is a major breaking change.
  
* Changed the licensing from LGPL to MIT.  F**k you Stallman.

+ Added functionality for FX shaders to determine if a projection matrix
  value is present and auto-update it accordingly.  The shader will look
  for a parameter named "_projectionMatrix", and if found, will be 
  automatically populated with the projection matrix from the current 
  clipping view port.
  
* Updated blur effect for framework logo.

* Modified animations to always be enabled on load.  This property should
  never have been saved.  However it is kept in the file format to keep
  from breaking it, but has no effect.
  
- Removed any code referencing W-Buffers.  This is from antiquated hardware 
  and would be unlikely to run on moderen operating systems.
  
+ Added an example to show to use the depth buffer for depth-sorting sprites.
  
+ Added the ability to play multiple animations at the same time in the 
  sprite editor animation editor interface.  This will allow the user to 
  see how combined animations will look when playing together.
  
+ Added an example to show how to use the particle system.

* Updated SlimDX to the most recent version (Sept/08).

* FINALLY!! I managed to get rid of the ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.DLL issue!!
  The problem was this:  When the user loaded the BZip file system plug-in, the
  plug-in loader would fail because it was unable to locate the aforementioned
  assembly.  Even if it was located in the same directory as the DLL.  
  
  Previously, the only way to get this working was to put a copy of 
  ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.DLL in your application directory.  This has now been fixed.  
  The plug-in can now be loaded without having ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.DLL in your 
  app directory.  As long as it can be located in the GAC, or the directory where your 
  plug-in resides, then it should be able to load.  This has been a pain in the ass 
  for a long time.
  
+ Added a background color command to the sprite clipper in the sprite editor
  application.  This will allow the user to mask the sprite image against a color
  if the default pattern makes it too difficult to see the sprites on the image.
  
+ Added a zoom window size value to the sprite clipper in the sprite editor.  This
  will allow the user to adjust the size of the zoomer window (note, this means the
  physical size of the zoom window, not the scale, the mouse wheel controls
  that).
  
+ Added a DualShader class to bind a Vertex and Pixel shader to the renderer at the
  same time.  This is necessary for SM 3 systems where it appears that a vertex shader
  is also required.  This was not the case for SM 2 where the pixel shader could be
  set without requiring a vertex shader.  The dual shader will use a default vertex
  and pixel shader when it is created (unless pixel/vertex shaders are passed in via
  the constructor, or assigned later).
  
* Fixed some issues with the sprite editor where animations would be corrupted when
  image bindings were changed.  Also fixed an issue with the Linq queries that
  enumerated render targets.
  
- Removed ImageShaderCache and ImageShaderList as these aren't necessary anymore.  The
  ImageShaders are now regular shaders and can be found in the ShaderCache.
  
* Fixed a bug in the shader serializer where it was saving the source as UTF-7.

* Changed ShaderSerializer to FXShaderSerializer and ShaderSerializer now handles
  objects derived from BaseShader.

+ Added BaseShader, PixelShader and VertexShader types.  These are shaders that don't use
  the HLSL effects system (except to compile).  BaseShader is the abstract type that
  Pixel/Vertex/ImageShader types are derived from.
  
+ Added ConstantShaderParameter for use by the objects that inherit from BaseShader.
  
* Changed ShaderParameter to FXShaderParameter.

+ Added IShaderParameter as the defacto interface for shader parameter objects.

* Changed Shader to FXShader to indicate that the shaders are based on the HLSL effects
  framework.  The Shader type is now a base class from which other shaders are derived.  

* Changed the Blur shader in the framework DLL from source code to a binary format.
  This was merely for convienence for myself.  Everytime I made a change to the resource
  file in the framework, the damn thing would try to put the contents of the shader in
  &lt;summary&gt; tags, which would generate a bunch of warnings.  I have NO idea why
  Visual Studio would do this.
  
* Fixed an issue in the shader FromResource function when trying to load a binary shader.
  Shader was being converted to a string regardless of the binary flag.
  
* Modified all shader From* static methods to take an extra parameter:  ShaderCompilerOptions.
  This allows the user to control the optimization level and debug info level for a shader.
  
+ Added a shader function object to be used with the image shaders.  These objects can be retrieved
  from the Shader object via the GetShaderFunction().
  
+ Added two new methods to the shader object:  CompileShader() and GetShaderFunction().  The 
  CompileShader() function is used to compile the source code for a shader, while the GetShaderFunction
  is used to retrieve a specific function from a shader and returns a ShaderFunction object. 

* Modified the shader subsystem extensively.  Renderable objects no longer have shaders attached
  (i.e. Sprite.Shader no longer exists).  This will break code that relied on shaders, but the
  old system didn't make any sense, especially when it came to multipass rendering.
  Shaders are now set via the main static Gorgon class with the property CurrentShader (e.g.
  Gorgon.CurrentShader = MyShader).  The user can set this to be equal to the shader (which will
  find the first valid technique), or a specific technique (which will render all passes for a
  technique) or a specific pass from a technique.  
  
* Added a new example for Visual Basic.NET - "TehShadowGn0s"

+ Added a new property to the renderable objects (sprites, textsprites, etc...) called
  ShaderPass.  This property will tell the renderer which shader pass to execute when
  drawing a sprite with a shader.
  
+ Adding a limited GUI interface to the framework.

+ Added FamilyName property to Font objects.  I can't believe I forgot to add this!

+ Added a particle emitter object to the framework library.  This one works like the
  HGE particle system (and in fact is directly based on it).

+ Added new simple value type called Range&lt;T&gt;.  This is just a value that holds
  a start and end value so it can be used to determine a range of values.  Use this
  instead of creating multiple properties on your object for ranged values.
  
+ Added a border color option to the sprites.  This is used with the Vertical/Horizontal
  Wrapping properties are set to Border.
  
* Modified sprite horizontal/vertical flipping to have better accuracy with flipped
  texture coordinates.
  
+ Added a utility library to the solution for higher level functionality such as sprite
  meshes and various other high level functionality in the future.
  
* Updated sprite editor project saving to now store its child files with relative paths.
  Prior to this it would only use a relative path if the sprite/image dependency was 
  located under the same path as the project file.  Now it will attempt to source the 
  files to a directory relative to the project file.
  
* Updated the device lost/reset code to no longer rely on exceptions, and instead use the
  result codes returned by SlimDX.
  
* Made some fixes to the vertex/index buffer objects.  This was due to some recent changes
  in SlimDX which does some validation on data being sent to the buffers.  This validation
  wasn't present before and thus Gorgon's original vertex/index buffer code got away with 
  doing its updates incorrectly (i.e. SlimDX is right, Gorgon is wrong in its approach).

* In keeping with the whole .NET 3.5 thing, I've made use of LINQ in the sprite editor.
  Holy crap it is epic.  I reduced a bunch of loops down to simple 1-3 line pieces of
  code with this stuff, it's wicked.
  
* Switched Gorgon, the tools and the examples over to .NET 3.5.  From this point forward
  Gorgon 1.1.x will require .NET 3.5.

* Modified the NoCleverName example to use bounding circles on the asteroids instead of
  rectangles.
  
* Sprite editor will now display the bounding circle in addition to the bounding rectangle
  for a sprite.
  
+ Added BoundingCircle on sprites.

+ Added a new value type: BoundingCircle.  This allows us to do collision checks bewteen
  a circle primitive and other primitives.
  
* Completely scrapped and rebuilt the animation editor in the sprite editor system. 
  The interface was kept pretty much the same, but new things like more tracks and copy,
  cut and paste for key frames have been added.  The system is now compliant with the
  new animation system.
  
* Made MASSIVE changes to the animation system.  Basically this system has pretty 
  much been rewritten.  The only interface that hasn't changed much is the Animation
  class.  If you've coded stuff using the old animation system your code WILL break
  there's no two ways about it.  However, your sprites that contain animations will
  work and will be updated to use the new system.  However, due to the differences in
  the way the old and new systems work, the results may not be 100% accurate.
  
  Here's a sub-listing of changes:
  * The grouped tracks like TransformTrack, FrameTrack, and ColorTrack are now 
    thankfully VERY dead and gone.  In their place is a more cohesive Tracks collection
    that will hold all the tracks for the animation.
  * No longer reliant on a group of properties (except for the KeyImage type).  We
    can now mark specific properties as animated and the system will do its best
    to deduce how to handle the types for those marked properties.
  * All of these animated properties are now individual tracks - the way it should
    have been right from the start.
  * Because Gorgon can only know about so many types, there's the option to hook into
    the animation events and define your own data type for a track and its keys.
  * The user can actually include the animation system in our own custom objects
    and animate the properties of custom object types by including the AnimationsList
    collection.
    
  In short it'll be a much better and more flexible animation system.  

* Modified Opacity property on renderables to use an int instead of a byte.  No,
  I really don't know what I was thinking.
  
* Changed ScaledWidth/ScaledHeight so that the user can now set the scaled size of
  the renderable object in the context of absolute width and height.  Prior to this
  the user could only set the scale relatively via the Scale or UniformScale 
  properties.
  
* Changed ICommonRenderable to IRenderableStates, since this is what this interface
  actually contained.
  
- Removed IMovable, IAnimatable, IRenderable.  These really served no purpose.
  
- Removed InvertFrameStatsColor from Gorgon.  Seemed kind of pointless really.

+ Added a Depth (and PrimitiveDepth to render targets) property to all Sprite types.
  This depth function will respect the Z-Buffer if one is set up via SetMode.  With this
  the user will be able to sort out which sprites get rendered before other sprites by
  using the Z-Buffer to test for occlusion regardless of the order of drawing.

+ Added new Depth buffer testing and writing properties to renderable objects.  And added
  global depth buffer test/writing properties as well.
  
- Took out a dumb restriction on the sprites that required the shader and/or image that 
  a sprite was bound with to be loaded BEFORE the sprite is loaded.  Now the system will 
  defer the binding of the image/shader until they're loaded into the Image/ShaderCache
  objects.
  
+ Added a framework DLL to help simplify development of applications in Gorgon.  This
  framework DLL is what used to be the framework in the Gorgon Library itself.  If your
  code is broken by the framework code removal from Gorgon, then adding this assembly 
  to your project should fix it.
  
+ Added a dialogs helper which is just a small DLL that gives extended dialog boxes
  for errors, confirmation and information.  This is the same as the dialogs in the
  SharpUtilities dependency.  However, unlike the SharpUtilities it is NOT required by
  Gorgon and as such you are free to not use it if you choose.
  
- Removing dependency on SharpUtilities.  This library has run its course and it's a
  pain for distributing projects using it when it's been updated.  All Native code and
  math functions are to be moved into Gorgon.  This will break things if you're using
  SharpUtilities.
  
+ Added new code to the PlugInFactory static object to check for signed assemblies.
  Also added code to compare the assembly public key with the users public key so
  that the user application can only load plug-ins that are signed by the user.
  
* Did some code clean up to break some silly habits (like catch { throw; } finally { }).

+ Added Save(stream), AssignRoot(string/Stream) methods and IsRootInStream property to 
  facilitate loading a file system object from a stream.  With this we can put packed 
  file systems into other packed file systems, or load a file system from a binary 
  data blob (e.g. imagine loading your file system from a database field).  Or even stream
  in a file system from a network connection.  Also added a FileSystemStreamOffset property 
  to set or show where the file system is located within a stream. Removed the setter 
  accessor on the Root property since we can now set it via the AssignRoot function.
  
* Modified the Blit() methods to take a BlitterSizeMode enumeration instead of a boolean
  as the scaling parameter.  This was done to be explicit about the case of size
  mismatch between the image and the parameters passed in to the blitter.  Added Color
  parameter to the blitter that will allow us to alter the color of the blitted target
  or image.
  
+ Added an example that will allow us to expose SlimDX's Direct 3D interfaces to
  our application via a plug-in.  This will allow us to mix in a 3D scene with our
  2D stuff.
  
- Dropped the shared plug-in project from the examples.  We no longer require (and
  honestly, never did require) a proxy DLL to host our base/abstract plug-in
  interface(s).  This opens up a great deal of flexibility, the reason for the proxy 
  DLL in the previous version was due to a circular dependency issue which has since 
  been resolved.  Now the user can add the host assembly (e.g. My2DWorldBuilder.exe)
  as a reference and use the interfaces exposed by that.  Of course, you can still
  use a proxy DLL if you wish.
  
* Updated the file system editor to handle encrypted files.

+ Added a new encrypted file system plug-in.  This is a test plug-in, and should
  NOT be used in a production environment.  If you wish to use this plug-in, you
  can modify the private key in the code and sign the plug-in assembly yourself.
