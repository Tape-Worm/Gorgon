	<h1>Gorgon Change Log</h1><hr>
	<pre>
March 9/2008 - Version - Current
================
* Changing file system editor to prompt with the plug-in locator if a plug-in cannot be
  found.  Current it opens the old file open dialog, this is pointless if it cannot load
  the plug-in.

* Updated an issue with Vertex/Index buffer creation on cards/chipsets without hardware
  transform and lighting (yeah, I didn't think they existed any more either).  The buffer
  would get created before it should have due to the detection of a non-hardware T&amp;L card.
  
* Updated an issue with the sprite editor.  Launching the image editor failed with
  a relative path.  Forcing the path to be decoded into an absolute path solved this
  issue.
  
* Updated an issue in the sprite editor where an edited image would become unbound from
  the sprites but still claim to be bound in the property listing.  This was corrected
  by re-assigning the image to the sprites after it had changed.
  
* Updated to the most current version of SlimDX.  Modified for any breaking changes.
  This release uses the March release of DirectX.  There was also a breaking change
  made in the HLSL compiler where half types cannot be global (I think that's what it
  was) and this broke the ShadersInSpaaaaace example.  The solution was to change 
  the type to a float.  This will likely be the initial NON-BETA release for Gorgon.
  As soon as the March version of SlimDX is released I will release a new (non-beta) 
  version of Gorgon shortly after (given time to update for breaking changes and the like)
  and I will release updated versions of the demo programs as well.

* Fixed an issue with the sprite editor.  When a project is loaded and the first 
  sprite selected the properties for that sprite did not show up.  The same issue
  affected new sprites, where after a new sprite was created the properties for
  the previously selected sprite would show instead of the new sprite (which is
  selected).  Traced this to the .Selected property of a list view item not firing
  the AfterSelected event in the list view control.
  
* Updated the version of SlimDX to the most current version as of March 2/2008.
  Modified Gorgon accordingly to handle the breaking changes introduced.  Gorgon
  will have a release (and an exit from BETA I'm thinking) when the new version of
  SlimDX is released for public consumption just to keep it somewhat synced.
  
- Dropped the DEBUG builds of SlimDX.  I don't use these often (in fact, almost
  never due to the debug runtime of DirectX and the object tracker in SlimDX) so I
  didn't see a reason to keep them here.  Debug builds can be created from the
  SlimDX source code at http://slimdx.googlecode.com/svn/trunk. (Note: you'll <u>need</u>
  a subversion client like <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</a> or something).

* Updated an issue in the TimingData structure where the framecount is returning 0
  all time.  That just ain't right.  It was returning the wrong frame counter and
  consequently was always being reset to 0 after a FPS update.
  
+ Added file type registration to installer.  .gorPack, and header.folderSystem
  file types will be opened by FileSystemEditor and .sprProj will be opened by
  SpriteEditor.

* Changed the base GorgonException class to be abstract.  Modified any attempts
  to throw the base class as an exception.
  
* Changes/additions to the documentation.  

+ Added the ability to open file systems from the command line with the file
  system editor.  This can open several file systems at the same time.
  
+ Added the ability to automatically re-open the last file systems loaded
  when the file system editor is launched.
  
* Changed the open command to use a common file dialog to open file system types.
  This change will alter how folder file systems are opened.  Folder file systems
  must now have the file "header.folderSystem" present in the root.  If you have
  created folder file systems, you will not be able to open them with the file system
  editor without first adding this file to the file system root.
  
  <strong><u>The following will fix the older folder file systems:</u></strong>
  1. Locate the header.folderSystem file in <i>{Your Gorgon Install Directory}</i>\Redist\Patch
  2. Copy this file into the root of any folder file system you may have.
  
  This should allow the file system editor to open any previous folder file system.
  
* Modified the FolderFileSystem and GorgonBZip2FileSystem object to now output a file 
  system type ID.  This ID is used by the editor to determine the type of file system
  when loading.  Furthermore, the FolderFileSystem object will write out a header.folderSystem
  file in the root of the folder file system.  Any file system objects implementing a
  folder file system MUST be sure to output this file.
  
* Modified the file system attribute to include an ID to identify the file system type
  so that the file system editor can open the file correctly.
  
* Fixed a bug in the Sprite Editor in which the current directory wasn't being
  set when opening a project.
  
* Fixed a bug in the Sprite Editor where the input plug-in would fail to load 
  because the editor was launched without setting a working directory.  Initially 
  it attempted to load the input plug-in from the current directory.
  
+ Added the ability to open a sprite project from the command line.
  (i.e. SpriteEditor "c:\my sprites\myspriteProject.sprProj")

* Updated default key/char map to add some missing keys (not quotes): ";|\"

+ Added a KeyMapCollection object which maps the keyboard keys to their 
  respective display characters.  This key map can be customized by the user
  for maximum flexibility.
  
* Changed the Keyboard.KeyMappings property to return a KeyMapCollection object 
  instead of a SortedList&lt;KeyboardKeys, KeyCharMap&gt; object.  This could 
  <u>possibly</u> break some things, so I apologize for that.
  
+ Added a KeyState property in the Keyboard object.  This is a KeyStateCollection 
  object that will record the states of various keys.  Unlike the obsolete
  indexer property, this will allow the user to set the key state as well.
  
- Obsoleted the Keyboard indexer (Keyboard[KeyboardKeys]), and will be removed 
  in the next release.
  
* Updated a bug regarding sorted collections in the Sharp Utilities dependency.

January 30/2008 - Version 1.0.2951.19564
===============
* Updated yet another bug in TextSprite.MeasureText() where the function would 
  ignore the wordWrap parameter.
  
* Updated a bug in TextSprite.MeasureText().  The function was reading the wrong
  string buffer when measuring the text.  It should have been measuring the text
  in the parameter, instead it was measuring the internal text buffer.
  
* Updated a bug in the sprite editor where the vertex offsets were returning the 
  vertex world position and not the relative offset positioning.
  
* Updated configuration files for BetterThanPortal and NoCleverName.  Plug-ins 
  location was pointing to the DEBUG versions of the plug-ins on x86 systems.  This 
  has been changed to point at the RELEASE versions.

January 11/2008 - Version 1.0.2932.40179
===============
* Modified the source package layout, integrated both x86 and x64 into one package.

+ Added x64 versions of the example solution/project files.

January 6/2008 - Version 1.0.2927.5698
==============
+ Initial BETA release.</pre>
