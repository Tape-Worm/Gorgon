This is the first BETA release.  Expect problems.

Please note that you will need Visual Studio 2008 in order to compile Gorgon, its tools and the examples.

There are x86 and x64 versions of the projects included.  The x64 projects are suffixed with '_x64'.

x64 Note:  If you see warning messages regarding mscorlib or system.somethingoranother claiming that it's for a different processor, please don't panic.  It's normal.  The runtime will automatically know which version of these assemblies to load (although those of you who've already done x64 code will probably know that already).
