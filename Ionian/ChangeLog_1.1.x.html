	<h1>Gorgon Change Log</h1><h2>1.1.x - Ionian</h2><hr/>
	<pre>
May 2/2008 - Version - Current
================================
* Modified the NoCleverName example to use bounding circles on the asteroids instead of
  rectangles.
  
+ Sprite editor will now display the bounding circle in addition to the bounding rectangle
  for a sprite.
  
* Added BoundingCircle on sprites.

+ Added a new value type: BoundingCircle.  This allows us to do collision checks bewteen
  a circle primitive and other primitives.
  
* Completely scrapped and rebuilt the animation editor in the sprite editor system. 
  The interface was kept pretty much the same, but new things like more tracks and copy,
  cut and paste for key frames have been added.  The system is now compliant with the
  new animation system.
  
* Made MASSIVE changes to the animation system.  Basically this system has pretty 
  much been rewritten.  The only interface that hasn't changed much is the Animation
  class.  If you've coded stuff using the old animation system your code WILL break
  there's no two ways about it.  
  
  Here's a sub-listing of changes:
  * The grouped tracks like TransformTrack, FrameTrack, and ColorTrack are now 
    thankfully VERY dead and gone.  In their place is a more cohesive Tracks collection
    that will hold all the tracks for the animation.
  * No longer reliant on a group of properties (except for the KeyImage type).  We
    can now mark specific properties as animated and the system will do its best
    to deduce how to handle the types for those marked properties.
  * All of these animated properties are now individual tracks - the way it should
    have been right from the start.
  * Because Gorgon can only know about so many types, there's the option to hook into
    the animation events and define your own data type for a track and its keys.
  * The user can actually include the animation system in our own custom objects
    and animate the properties of custom object types by including the AnimationsList
    collection.
    
  In short it'll be a much better and more flexible animation system.  

* Updated to the latest version of SlimDX (May 1/08)

* Modified Opacity property on renderables to use an int instead of a byte.  No,
  I really don't know what I was thinking.
  
* Changed ScaledWidth/ScaledHeight so that the user can now set the scaled size of
  the renderable object in the context of absolute width and height.  Prior to this
  the user could only set the scale relatively via the Scale or UniformScale 
  properties.
  
* Changed ICommonRenderable to IRenderableStates, since this is what this interface
  actually contained.
  
- Removed IMovable, IAnimatable, IRenderable.  These really served no purpose.
  
- Removed InvertFrameStatsColor from Gorgon.  Seemed kind of pointless really.

+ Added a Depth (and PrimitiveDepth to render targets) property to all Sprite types.
  This depth function will respect the Z-Buffer if one is set up via SetMode.  With this
  the user will be able to sort out which sprites get rendered before other sprites by
  using the Z-Buffer to test for occlusion regardless of the order of drawing.

+ Added new Depth buffer testing and writing properties to renderable objects.  And added
  global depth buffer test/writing properties as well.
  
- Took out a dumb restriction on the sprites that required the shader and/or image that 
  a sprite was bound with to be loaded BEFORE the sprite is loaded.  Now the system will 
  defer the binding of the image/shader until they're loaded into the Image/ShaderCache
  objects.
  
+ Added a framework DLL to help simplify development of applications in Gorgon.  This
  framework DLL is what used to be the framework in the Gorgon Library itself.  If your
  code is broken by the framework code removal from Gorgon, then adding this assembly 
  to your project should fix it.
  
+ Added a dialogs helper which is just a small DLL that gives extended dialog boxes
  for errors, confirmation and information.  This is the same as the dialogs in the
  SharpUtilities dependency.  However, unlike the SharpUtilities it is NOT required by
  Gorgon and as such you are free to not use it if you choose.
  
- Removed framework code from Gorgon and moved it into its own DLL.  This will break things
  if you are using the framework code.  
  
- Removing dependency on SharpUtilities.  This library has run its course and it's a
  pain for distributing projects using it when it's been updated.  All Native code and
  math functions are to be moved into Gorgon.  This will break things if you're using
  SharpUtilities.
  
+ Added new code to the PlugInFactory static object to check for signed assemblies.
  Also added code to compare the assembly public key with the users public key so
  that the user application can only load plug-ins that are signed by the user.
  
* Did some code clean up to break some silly habits (like catch { throw; } finally { }).

+ Added Save(stream), AssignRoot(string/Stream) methods and IsRootInStream property to 
  facilitate loading a file system object from a stream.  With this we can put packed 
  file systems into other packed file systems, or load a file system from a binary 
  data blob (e.g. imagine loading your file system from a database field).  Or even stream
  in a file system from a network connection.  Also added a FileSystemStreamOffset property 
  to set or show where the file system is located within a stream. Removed the setter 
  accessor on the Root property since we can now set it via the AssignRoot function.
  
* Modified the Blit() methods to take a BlitterSizeMode enumeration instead of a boolean
  as the scaling parameter.  This was done to be explicit about the case of size
  mismatch between the image and the parameters passed in to the blitter.  Added Color
  parameter to the blitter that will allow us to alter the color of the blitted target
  or image.
  
* Modified the Direct 3D plug-in interface to expose a method to flush the rendering
  pipeline.  This should be called before rendering your 3D scene or else you may get
  odd behaviour from the previous render setup used by Gorgon. 
  
+ Added an example that will allow us to expose SlimDX's Direct 3D interfaces to
  our application via a plug-in.  This will allow us to mix in a 3D scene with our
  2D stuff.
  
- Dropped the shared plug-in project from the examples.  We no longer require (and
  honestly, never did require) a proxy DLL to host our base/abstract plug-in
  interface(s).  This opens up a great deal of flexibility, the reason for the proxy 
  DLL in the previous version was due to a circular dependency issue which has since 
  been resolved.  Now the user can add the host assembly (e.g. My2DWorldBuilder.exe)
  as a reference and use the interfaces exposed by that.  Of course, you can still
  use a proxy DLL if you wish.
  
* Updated the file system editor to handle encrypted files.

+ Added a new encrypted file system plug-in.  This is a test plug-in, and should
  NOT be used in a production environment.  If you wish to use this plug-in, you
  can modify the private key in the code and sign the plug-in assembly yourself.
