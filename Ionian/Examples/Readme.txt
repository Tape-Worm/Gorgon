To compile these examples you must compile a RELEASE copy of Gorgon.  

Even if you compile a DEBUG version of the examples, you will need a RELEASE version 
of Gorgon itself.  This is because the examples all reference the release version of 
the Gorgon assemblies and there's no way to specify which version to reference depending 
on configuration.  

If you want, you can change all the references to point at the DEBUG version of Gorgon 
and its DEBUG plug-ins, however this will be a bit of effort.

Please note that some examples may show a block for some symbols in the text displayed in
some of the programs.  This is due to the installed font not supporting these extended 
characters.  This is beyond my control as I am not allowed to distribute this font file (Arial).
