When you use D3D_COMPILE_STANDARD_FILE_INCLUDE, you must specify the source file name in the pSourceName parameter; the compiler will derive the initial relative directory from pSourceName.</para>

      <remarks>	
            A shader can take n inputs and can produce m outputs. The order of the input (or output) parameters, their associated types, and any attached semantics make up the shader signature. Each shader has an input and an output signature.When compiling a shader or an effect, some API calls validate shader signatures  That is, they compare the output signature of one shader (like a vertex shader) with the input signature of another shader (like a pixel shader). This ensures that a shader outputs data that is compatible with a downstream shader that is consuming that data. Compatible means that a shader signature is a exact-match subset of the preceding shader stage. Exact match means parameter types and semantics must exactly match. Subset means that a parameter that is not required by a downstream stage, does not need to include that parameter in its shader signature.Get a shader-signature from a shader or an effect by calling APIs such as <see cref="M:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.ShaderReflection.GetInputParameterDescription(System.Int32)" />.

      <remarks>	
            Resource priorities determine which resource to evict from video memory when the system has run out of video memory. The resource will not be lost; it will be removed from video memory and placed into system memory, or possibly placed onto the hard drive. The resource will be loaded back into video memory when it is required.A resource that is set to the maximum priority, <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.ResourcePriority.Maximum" />, is only evicted if there is no other way of resolving the incoming memory request. The Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) tries to split an incoming memory request to its minimum size and evict lower-priority resources before evicting a resource with maximum priority.Changing the priorities of resources should be done carefully. The wrong eviction priorities could be a detriment to performance rather than an improvement.

Use this flag to test code paths that regenerate resource content on reclaim.  You cannot use this flag in combination with D3D11_DEBUG_FEATURE_NEVER_DISCARD_OFFERED_RESOURCE. D3D11_DEBUG_FEATURE_NEVER_DISCARD_OFFERED_RESOURCE (0x10)When you call IDXGIDevice2::OfferResources to offer resources while this flag is enabled, their content is never discarded.  Use this flag to test code paths that do not need to regenerate resource content on reclaim.  You cannot use this flag in combination with D3D11_DEBUG_FEATURE_ALWAYS_DISCARD_OFFERED_RESOURCE.?The behavior of the IDXGIDevice2::OfferResources and IDXGIDevice2::ReclaimResources methods depends on system-wide memory pressure. Therefore, the scenario where content is lost and must be regenerated is uncommon for most applications.  The preceding new options in the Direct3D debug layer let you simulate that scenario consistently and test code paths.The following flag is supported by the Direct3D 11.1 runtime.D3D11_DEBUG_FEATURE_AVOID_BEHAVIOR_CHANGING_DEBUG_AIDS (0x40)Disables the following default debugging behavior.?When the debug layer is enabled, it performs certain actions to reveal application problems.  By setting the D3D11_DEBUG_FEATURE_AVOID_BEHAVIOR_CHANGING_DEBUG_AIDS feature-mask flag, you can enable the debug layer without getting the following default debugging behavior:If an application calls ID3D11DeviceContext1::DiscardView, the runtime fills in the resource with a random color. If an application calls IDXGISwapChain1::Present1 with partial presentation parameters, the runtime ignores the partial presentation information.

      <remarks>
            To share a resource between two Direct3D 10 devices the resource must have been created with the  <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.Shared" /> flag, if it was created using the ID3D10Device interface.  If it was created using the IDXGIDevice interface, then the resource is always shared. The REFIID, or GUID, of the interface to the resource can be obtained by using the __uuidof() macro.  For example, __uuidof(ID3D10Buffer) will get the GUID of the interface to a buffer resource. When sharing a resource between two Direct3D 10 devices the unique handle of the resource can be obtained by querying the resource for the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Resource" /> interface and then calling {{GetSharedHandle}}.
            <code> IDXGIResource* pOtherResource(NULL);
            hr = pOtherDeviceResource-&gt;QueryInterface( __uuidof(IDXGIResource), (void**)&amp;pOtherResource );
            HANDLE sharedHandle;
            pOtherResource-&gt;GetSharedHandle(&amp;sharedHandle); </code>
            The only resources that can be shared are 2D non-mipmapped textures. To share a resource between a Direct3D 9 device and a Direct3D 10 device the texture must have been created using  the pSharedHandle argument of {{CreateTexture}}.   The shared Direct3D 9 handle is then passed to OpenSharedResource in the hResource argument. The following code illustrates the method calls involved.
            <code> sharedHandle = NULL; // must be set to NULL to create, can use a valid handle here to open in D3D9
            pDevice9-&gt;CreateTexture(..., pTex2D_9, &amp;sharedHandle);
            ...
            pDevice10-&gt;OpenSharedResource(sharedHandle, __uuidof(ID3D10Resource), (void**)(&amp;tempResource10));
            tempResource10-&gt;QueryInterface(__uuidof(ID3D10Texture2D), (void**)(&amp;pTex2D_10));
            tempResource10-&gt;Release();
            // now use pTex2D_10 with pDevice10    </code>
            Textures being shared from D3D9 to D3D10 have the following restrictions.  Textures must be 2D Only 1 mip level is allowed Texture must have default usage Texture must be write only MSAA textures are not allowed Bind flags must have SHADER_RESOURCE and RENDER_TARGET set Only R10G10B10A2_UNORM, R16G16B16A16_FLOAT and R8G8B8A8_UNORM formats are allowed  If a shared texture is updated on one device <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.Flush" /> must be called on that device.

      <remarks>	
            For example code, see How to: Create a Vertex Buffer,  How to: Create an Index Buffer or How to: Create a Constant Buffer.The Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available on Windows Developer Preview and later operating systems, provides the following new functionality for CreateBuffer.You can create a constant buffer that is larger than the maximum constant buffer size that a shader can access (4096 32-bit*4-component constants ? 64KB).  When you bind the constant buffer to the pipeline (for example, via PSSetConstantBuffers or PSSetConstantBuffers1), you can define a range of the buffer that the shader can access that fits within the 4096 constant limit.The runtime will emulate this feature for feature level 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3; therefore, this feature is supported for feature level 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3.  This feature is always available on new drivers for feature level 10 and higher.  On existing drivers that are implemented to feature level 10 and higher, a call to CreateBuffer to request a constant buffer that is larger than 4096 fails.

      <remarks>	
            A resource is made up of one or more subresources; a view identifies which subresources to allow the pipeline to access. In addition, each resource is bound to the pipeline using a view. A shader-resource view is designed to bind any buffer or texture resource to the shader stages using the following  API methods: <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VertexShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.IntPtr)" />, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.GeometryShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.IntPtr)" /> and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.PixelShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.IntPtr)" />.Because a view is fully typed, this means that typeless resources become fully typed when bound to the pipeline.Note??To successfully create a shader-resource view from a typeless buffer (for example, <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32A32_Typeless" />), you must set the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.BufferAllowRawViews" /> flag when you create the buffer.The Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available starting with Windows Developer Preview, allows you to use CreateShaderResourceView for the following new purpose.You can create shader-resource views of video resources so that Direct3D shaders can process those shader-resource views. These video resources are either Texture2D or Texture2DArray. The value in the ViewDimension member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceViewDescription" /> structure for a created shader-resource view must match the type of video resource, D3D11_SRV_DIMENSION_TEXTURE2D          for Texture2D and D3D11_SRV_DIMENSION_TEXTURE2DARRAY for Texture2DArray. Additionally, the format of the underlying video resource restricts the formats that the view can use. The video resource format values on the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Format" /> reference page specify the format values that views are restricted to.The runtime read+write conflict prevention logic (which stops a resource from being bound as an SRV and RTV or UAV at the same time) treats views of different parts of the same video surface as conflicting for simplicity.  Therefore, the runtime does not allow an application to read from luma while the application simultaneously renders to chroma in the same surface even though the hardware might allow these simultaneous operations.

            A render-target view can be bound to the output-merger stage by calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.OutputMergerStage.SetRenderTargets(System.Int32,System.IntPtr,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DepthStencilView)" />.The Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available starting with Windows Developer Preview, allows you to use CreateRenderTargetView for the following new purpose.You can create render-target views of video resources so that Direct3D shaders can process those render-target views. These video resources are either Texture2D or Texture2DArray. The value in the ViewDimension member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.RenderTargetViewDescription" /> structure for a created render-target view must match the type of video resource, <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.RenderTargetViewDimension.Texture2D" />          for Texture2D and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.RenderTargetViewDimension.Texture2DArray" /> for Texture2DArray. Additionally, the format of the underlying video resource restricts the formats that the view can use. The video resource format values on the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Format" /> reference page specify the format values that views are restricted to.The runtime read+write conflict prevention logic (which stops a resource from being bound as an SRV and RTV or UAV at the same time) treats views of different parts of the same video surface as conflicting for simplicity.  Therefore, the runtime does not allow an application to read from luma while the application simultaneously renders to chroma in the same surface even though the hardware might allow these simultaneous operations.

      <remarks>	
            After creating an input layout object, it must be bound to the input-assembler stage before calling a draw API.Once an input-layout object is created from a shader signature, the input-layout object can be reused with any other shader that has an identical input signature (semantics included). This can simplify the creation of input-layout objects when you are working with many shaders with identical inputs.If a data type in the input-layout declaration does not match the data type in a shader-input signature, CreateInputLayout will generate a warning during compilation. The warning is simply to call attention to the fact that the data may be reinterpreted when read from a register. You may either disregard this warning (if reinterpretation is intentional) or make the data types match in both declarations to eliminate the warning.

      <remarks>	
            A deferred context is a thread-safe context that you can use to record graphics commands on a thread other than the main rendering thread.  Using a deferred context, you can record graphics commands into a command list that is encapsulated by the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.CommandList" /> interface.  After all scene items are recorded, you can then submit them to the main render thread for final rendering.  In this manner, you can perform rendering tasks concurrently across multiple threads and potentially improve performance in multi-core CPU scenarios.You can create multiple deferred contexts.Note??If you use the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceCreationFlags.SingleThreaded" /> value to create the device that is represented by <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device" />, the CreateDeferredContext method will fail, and you will not be able to create a deferred context.For more information about deferred contexts, see Immediate and Deferred Rendering.

      <remarks>	
            The REFIID, or <see cref="T:System.Guid" />, of the interface to the resource can be obtained by using the __uuidof() macro. For example, __uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer" />) will get the <see cref="T:System.Guid" /> of the interface to a buffer resource.The unique handle of the resource is obtained differently depending on the type of device that originally created the resource.To share a resource between two Direct3D 11 devices the resource must have been created with the  <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.Shared" /> flag, if it was created using the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device" /> interface.  If it was created using a DXGI device interface, then the resource is always shared.The REFIID, or <see cref="T:System.Guid" />, of the interface to the resource can be obtained by using the __uuidof() macro.  For example, __uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer" />) will get the <see cref="T:System.Guid" /> of the interface to a buffer resource.When sharing a resource between two Direct3D 10/11 devices the unique handle of the resource can be obtained by querying the resource for the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Resource" /> interface and then calling GetSharedHandle.<code><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Resource" />* pOtherResource(<c>null</c>);	
            hr = pOtherDeviceResource-&gt;QueryInterface( __uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Resource" />), (void**)&amp;pOtherResource );

            pOtherResource-&gt;GetSharedHandle(&amp;sharedHandle); 	
            </code>The only resources that can be shared are 2D non-mipmapped textures.To share a resource between a Direct3D 9 device and a Direct3D 11 device the texture must have been created using  the pSharedHandle argument of CreateTexture.   The shared Direct3D 9 handle is then passed to OpenSharedResource in the hResource argument.The following code illustrates the method calls involved.<code>	
             sharedHandle = <c>null</c>; // must be set to <c>null</c> to create, can use a valid handle here to open in D3D9 	
            pDevice9-&gt;CreateTexture(..., pTex2D_9, &amp;sharedHandle); 	
            ... 	
            pDevice11-&gt;OpenSharedResource(sharedHandle, __uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource" />), (void**)(&amp;tempResource11)); 	
            tempResource11-&gt;QueryInterface(__uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2D" />), (void**)(&amp;pTex2D_11)); 	
            tempResource11-&gt;Release(); 	
            // now use pTex2D_11 with pDevice11    	
            </code>Textures being shared from D3D9 to D3D11 have the following restrictions.Textures must be 2D Only 1 mip level is allowed Texture must have default usage Texture must be write only MSAA textures are not allowed Bind flags must have SHADER_RESOURCE and RENDER_TARGET set Only R10G10B10A2_UNORM, R16G16B16A16_FLOAT and R8G8B8A8_UNORM formats are allowedIf a shared texture is updated on one device <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.Flush" /> must be called on that device.

      <remarks>	
            When multisampling a texture, the number of quality levels available for an adapter is dependent on the texture format used and the number of  samples requested. The maximum number of quality levels is defined by <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.MultisampleCountMaximum" /> in D3D11.h. If this method returns 0, the format  and sample count combination is not supported for the installed adapter.Furthermore, the definition of a quality level is up to each hardware vendor to define, however no facility is provided by Direct3D to help discover  this information.Note that FEATURE_LEVEL_10_1 devices are required to support 4x MSAA for all render targets except R32G32B32A32 and R32G32B32. FEATURE_LEVEL_11_0 devices are required to support 4x MSAA for all render target formats, and 8x MSAA for all render target formats  except R32G32B32A32 formats.

            Length parameters can be <c>null</c>, which indicates the application is not interested in the length nor the corresponding string value. When a length parameter is non-<c>null</c> and the corresponding string is <c>null</c>, the input value of the length parameter is ignored, and the length of the corresponding string (including terminating <c>null</c>) will be returned through the length parameter. When length and the corresponding parameter are both non-<c>null</c>, the input value of length is checked to ensure there is enough room, and then the length of the string (including terminating <c>null</c> character) is passed out through the length parameter.

            The data stored in the device with this method can be retrieved with <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.GetPrivateData(System.Guid,System.Int32@,System.IntPtr)" />.The data and guid set with this method will typically be application-defined.If an application uses this method to change the device type using GUID_DeviceType, results are undefined. However, GUID_DeviceType can be used to retrieve the device type using <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.GetPrivateData(System.Guid,System.Int32@,System.IntPtr)" />.The debug layer reports memory leaks by outputting a list of object interface references along with their friendly names. The default friendly name is "&lt;unnamed&gt;". You can set the friendly name so that you can determine if the corresponding object interface reference caused the leak. To set the friendly name, use the SetPrivateData method and the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.CommonGuid.DebugObjectName" /><see cref="T:System.Guid" /> that is in D3Dcommon.h. For example, to give pContext a friendly name of My name, use the following code:<code>	
             static const char c_szName[] = "My name";	
            hr = pContext-&gt;SetPrivateData( <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.CommonGuid.DebugObjectName" />, sizeof( c_szName ) - 1, c_szName );

      <remarks>	
            Set an exception-mode flag to elevate an error condition to a non-continuable exception.Whenever an error occurs, a Direct3D device enters the DEVICEREMOVED state and if the appropriate exception flag has been set, an exception is raised. A raised exception is designed to terminate an application. Before termination, the last chance an application has to persist data is by using an UnhandledExceptionFilter (see Structured Exception Handling). In general, UnhandledExceptionFilters are leveraged to try to persist data when an application is crashing (to disk, for example). Any code that executes during an UnhandledExceptionFilter is not guaranteed to reliably execute (due to possible process corruption). Any data that the UnhandledExceptionFilter manages to persist, before the UnhandledExceptionFilter crashes again, should be treated as suspect, and therefore inspected by a new, non-corrupted process to see if it is usable.

            Call ID3D10Device::SOSetTargets (before any draw calls) to stream data out; call SOSetTargets with NULL to stop streaming data out. For an example, see Exercise 01 from the GDC 2007 workshop, which sets the stream output rendertargets before calling draw methods in the RenderInstanceToStream function. An offset of -1 will cause the stream output buffer to be appended, continuing after the last location written to the buffer in a previous stream output pass. Calling this method using a buffer that is currently bound for writing will effectively bind NULL instead because a buffer cannot be bound as both an input and an output at the same time. The {{Debug Layer}} will generate a warning whenever a resource is prevented from being bound simultaneously as an input and an output, but this will not prevent invalid data from being used by the runtime. The method will not hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. For that reason, applications should be careful not to release an interface currently in use by the device.

            The method will hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. This differs from the device state behavior in Direct3D 10.The Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available starting with Windows Developer Preview, can bind a larger number of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer" /> resources to the shader than the maximum constant buffer size that is supported by shaders (4096 constants ? 4*32-bit components each).  When you bind such a large buffer, the shader can access only the first 4096 4*32-bit component constants in the buffer, as if 4096 constants is the full size of the buffer.If the application wants the shader to access other parts of the buffer, it must call the CSSetConstantBuffers1 method instead.

      <summary>	
            Copy the entire contents of the source resource to the destination resource using the GPU. 	
            </summary>
      <remarks>	
            This method is unusual in that it causes the GPU to perform the copy operation (similar to a memcpy by the CPU). As a result, it has a few restrictions designed for improving performance. For instance, the source and destination resources:  Must be different resources. Must be the same type. Must have identical dimensions (including width, height, depth, and size as appropriate). Will only be copied. CopyResource does not support any stretch, color key, blend, or format conversions. Must have compatible DXGI formats, which means the formats must be identical or at least from the same type group. For example, a DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_FLOAT texture can be copied to an DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_UINT texture since both of these formats are in the DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_TYPELESS group. Might not be currently mapped.  You cannot use an {{Immutable}} resource as a destination. You can use a   {{depth-stencil}} resource as either a source or a destination.  Resources created with multisampling capability (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SampleDescription" />) can be used as source and destination only if both source and destination have identical multisampled count and quality. If source and destination differ in multisampled count and quality or if one is multisampled and the other is not multisampled the call to ID3D11DeviceContext::CopyResource fails. The method is an asynchronous call which may be added to the command-buffer queue. This attempts to remove pipeline stalls that may occur when copying data.  An application that only needs to copy a portion of the data in a resource should use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopySubresourceRegion_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion})" /> instead.

            Copy a region from a source resource to a destination resource.	
            </summary>
      <remarks>	
            The source box must be within the size of the source resource. The destination offsets, (x, y, and z) allow the source box to be offset when writing into the destination resource; however, the dimensions of the source box and the offsets must be within the size of the resource. If the resources are buffers, all coordinates are in bytes; if the resources are textures, all coordinates are in texels. {{D3D11CalcSubresource}} is a helper function for calculating subresource indexes. CopySubresourceRegion performs the copy on the GPU (similar to a memcpy by the CPU). As a consequence, the source and destination resources:  Must be different subresources (although they can be from the same resource). Must be the same type. Must have compatible DXGI formats (identical or from the same type group). For example, a DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_FLOAT texture can be copied to an DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_UINT texture since both of these formats are in the DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_TYPELESS group. May not be currently mapped.  CopySubresourceRegion only supports copy; it does not support any stretch, color key, blend, or format conversions. An application that needs to copy an entire resource should use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopyResource_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource)" /> instead. CopySubresourceRegion is an asynchronous call which may be added to the command-buffer queue, this attempts to remove pipeline stalls that may occur when copying data. See performance considerations for more details. Note??If you use CopySubresourceRegion with a depth-stencil buffer or a multisampled resource, you must copy the whole subresource. In this situation, you must pass 0 to the DstX, DstY, and DstZ parameters and NULL to the pSrcBox parameter. In addition, source and destination resources, which are represented by the pSrcResource and pDstResource parameters, should have identical sample count values. Example The following code snippet copies a box (located at (120,100),(200,220)) from a source texture into a reqion (10,20),(90,140) in a destination texture. 	
            <code> D3D11_BOX sourceRegion;	
            sourceRegion.left = 120;	
            sourceRegion.right = 200;	
            sourceRegion.top = 100;	
            sourceRegion.bottom = 220;	
            sourceRegion.front = 0;	
            sourceRegion.back = 1; pd3dDeviceContext-&gt;CopySubresourceRegion( pDestTexture, 0, 10, 20, 0, pSourceTexture, 0, &amp;sourceRegion ); </code>	
            	
             Notice, that for a 2D texture, front and back are set to 0 and 1 respectively.

      <remarks>	
            This API is most useful when re-using the resulting rendertarget of one render pass as an input to a second render pass. The source and destination resources must be the same resource type and have the same dimensions. In addition, they must have compatible formats. There are three scenarios for this:  ScenarioRequirements Source and destination are prestructured and typedBoth the source and destination must have identical formats and that format must be specified in the Format parameter. One resource is prestructured and typed and the other is prestructured and typelessThe typed resource must have a format that is compatible with the typeless resource (i.e. the typed resource is DXGI_FORMAT_R32_FLOAT and the typeless resource is DXGI_FORMAT_R32_TYPELESS). The format of the typed resource must be specified in the Format parameter. Source and destination are prestructured and typelessBoth the source and desintation must have the same typeless format (i.e. both must have DXGI_FORMAT_R32_TYPELESS), and the Format parameter must specify a format that is compatible with the source and destination (i.e. if both are DXGI_FORMAT_R32_TYPELESS then DXGI_FORMAT_R32_FLOAT could be specified in the Format parameter). For example, given the DXGI_FORMAT_R16G16B16A16_TYPELESS format:  The source (or dest) format could be DXGI_FORMAT_R16G16B16A16_UNORM The dest (or source) format could be DXGI_FORMAT_R16G16B16A16_FLOAT    ?

The Direct3D 11 and earlier runtimes limited mapping to vertex or index buffers.

      <remarks>	
            Queries in a deferred context are limited to predicated drawing. That is, you cannot call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.GetDataInternal(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous,System.IntPtr,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.AsynchronousFlags)" /> on a deferred context to get data about a query; you can only call GetData on the immediate context to get data about a query. For predicated drawing, the results of a predication-type query are used by the GPU and not returned to an application. For more information about predication and predicated drawing, see D3D11DeviceContext::SetPredication.GetData retrieves the data that the runtime collected between calls to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.Begin(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous)" /> and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.End(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous)" />.  Certain queries only require a call to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.End(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous)" /> in which case the data returned by GetData is accurate up to the last call to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.End(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous)" />. For information about the queries that only require a call to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.End(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous)" /> and about the type of data that GetData retrieves for each query, see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.QueryType" />.If DataSize is 0, GetData is only used to check status.An application gathers counter data by calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.Begin(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous)" />, issuing some graphics commands, calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.End(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous)" />, and then calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.GetDataInternal(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous,System.IntPtr,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.AsynchronousFlags)" /> to get data about what happened in between the Begin and End calls.

      <remarks>	
            The predicate must be in the "issued" or "signaled" state to be used for predication. While the predicate is set for predication, calls to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.Begin(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous)" /> and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.End(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous)" /> are invalid.This method is used to denote that subsequent rendering and resource manipulation commands are not actually performed if the resulting Predicate data of the Predicate is equal to the PredicateValue. However, some Predicates are only hints, so they may not actually prevent operations from being performed.The primary usefulness of Predication is to allow an application to issue graphics commands without taking the performance hit of spinning, waiting for <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.GetDataInternal(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous,System.IntPtr,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.AsynchronousFlags)" /> to return. So, Predication can occur while <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.GetDataInternal(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous,System.IntPtr,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.AsynchronousFlags)" /> returns S_FALSE. Another way to think of it: an application can also use Predication as a fallback, if it is possible that <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.GetDataInternal(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous,System.IntPtr,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.AsynchronousFlags)" /> returns S_FALSE. If <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.GetDataInternal(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous,System.IntPtr,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.AsynchronousFlags)" /> returns <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.Ok" />, the application can skip calling the graphics commands manually with it's own application logic.

            </summary>
      <remarks>	
            A draw API submits work to the rendering pipeline. This API submits work of an unknown size that was processed by the input assembler, vertex shader, and stream-output stages;  the work may or may not have gone through the geometry-shader stage.After data has been streamed out to stream-output stage buffers, those buffers can be again bound to the Input Assembler stage at input slot 0 and DrawAuto will draw them without the application needing to know the amount of data that was written to the buffers. A measurement of the amount of data written to the SO stage buffers is maintained internally when the data is streamed out. This means that the CPU does not need to fetch the measurement before re-binding the data that was streamed as input data. Although this amount is tracked internally, it is still the responsibility of applications to use input layouts to describe the format of the data in the SO stage buffers so that the layouts are available when the buffers are again bound to the input assembler.The following diagram shows the DrawAuto process.Calling DrawAuto does not change the state of the streaming-output buffers that were bound again as inputs.DrawAuto only works when drawing with one input buffer bound as an input to the IA stage at slot 0. Applications must create the SO buffer resource with both binding flags, <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.BindFlags.VertexBuffer" /> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.BindFlags.StreamOutput" />.This API does not support indexing or instancing.If an application needs to retrieve the size of the streaming-output buffer, it can query for statistics on streaming output by using <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.QueryType.StreamOutputStatistics" />.

      </param>
      <remarks>	
            The source box must be within the size of the source resource. The destination offsets, (x, y, and z) allow the source box to be offset when writing into the destination resource; however, the dimensions of the source box and the offsets must be within the size of the resource.If the resources are buffers, all coordinates are in bytes; if the resources are textures, all coordinates are in texels. D3D11CalcSubresource is a helper function for calculating subresource indexes.CopySubresourceRegion performs the copy on the GPU (similar to a memcpy by the CPU). As a consequence, the source and destination resources:Must be different subresources (although they can be from the same resource). Must be the same type. Must have compatible DXGI formats (identical or from the same type group). For example, a <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_Float" /> texture can be copied to an <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_UInt" /> texture since both of these formats are in the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_Typeless" /> group. May not be currently mapped.CopySubresourceRegion only supports copy; it does not support any stretch, color key, blend, or format conversions. An application that needs to copy an entire resource should use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopyResource_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource)" /> instead.CopySubresourceRegion is an asynchronous call, which may be added to the command-buffer queue, this attempts to remove pipeline stalls that may occur when copying data. For more information about pipeline stalls, see performance considerations.Note??If you use CopySubresourceRegion with a depth-stencil buffer or a multisampled resource, you must copy the whole subresource. In this situation, you must pass 0 to the DstX, DstY, and DstZ parameters and <c>null</c> to the pSrcBox parameter. In addition, source and destination resources, which are represented by the pSrcResource and pDstResource parameters, should have identical sample count values.ExampleThe following code snippet copies a box (located at (120,100),(200,220)) from a source texture into a reqion (10,20),(90,140) in a destination texture.<code><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion" /> sourceRegion;	
            sourceRegion.left = 120;	
            sourceRegion.right = 200;	
            sourceRegion.top = 100;	
            sourceRegion.bottom = 220;	
            sourceRegion.front = 0;	
            sourceRegion.back = 1; pd3dDeviceContext-&gt;CopySubresourceRegion( pDestTexture, 0, 10, 20, 0, pSourceTexture, 0, &amp;sourceRegion );	
            	
            </code>Notice, that for a 2D texture, front and back are set to 0 and 1 respectively.

      <remarks>	
            This method is unusual in that it causes the GPU to perform the copy operation (similar to a memcpy by the CPU). As a result, it has a few restrictions designed for improving performance. For instance, the source and destination resources:Must be different resources. Must be the same type. Must have identical dimensions (including width, height, depth, and size as appropriate). Will only be copied. CopyResource does not support any stretch, color key, blend, or format conversions. Must have compatible DXGI formats, which means the formats must be identical or at least from the same type group. For example, a <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_Float" /> texture can be copied to an <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_UInt" /> texture since both of these formats are in the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_Typeless" /> group. Might not be currently mapped.You cannot use an Immutable resource as a destination. You can use a   depth-stencil resource as either a source or a destination.  Resources created with multisampling capability (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SampleDescription" />) can be used as source and destination only if both source and destination have identical multisampled count and quality. If source and destination differ in multisampled count and quality or if one is multisampled and the other is not multisampled the call to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopyResource_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource)" /> fails.The method is an asynchronous call which may be added to the command-buffer queue. This attempts to remove pipeline stalls that may occur when copying data.An application that only needs to copy a portion of the data in a resource should use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopySubresourceRegion_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion})" /> instead.

      <remarks>	
            For a shader-constant buffer; set pDstBox to <c>null</c>. It is not possible to use this method to partially update a shader-constant buffer.A resource cannot be used as a destination if:the resource is created with immutable or dynamic usage. the resource is created as a depth-stencil resource. the resource is created with multisampling capability (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SampleDescription" />).When UpdateSubresource returns, the application is free to change or even free the data pointed to by pSrcData because the method has already copied/snapped away the original contents.The performance of UpdateSubresource depends on whether or not there is contention for the destination resource. For example, contention for a vertex buffer resource occurs when the application executes a Draw call and later calls UpdateSubresource on the same vertex buffer before the Draw call is actually executed by the GPU.When there is contention for the resource, UpdateSubresource will perform 2 copies of the source data. First, the data is copied by the CPU to a temporary storage space accessible by the command buffer. This copy happens before the method returns.  A second copy is then performed by the GPU to copy the source data into non-mappable memory. This second copy happens asynchronously because it is executed by GPU when the command buffer is flushed. When there is no resource contention, the behavior of UpdateSubresource is dependent on which is faster (from the CPU's perspective): copying the data to the command buffer and then having a second copy execute when the command buffer is flushed, or having the CPU copy the data to the final resource location. This is dependent on the architecture of the underlying system.To better understand the source row pitch and source depth pitch parameters, the following illustration shows a 3D volume texture.Each block in this visual represents an element of data, and the size of each element is dependent on the resource's format. For example, if the resource format is <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32A32_Float" />, the size of each element would be 128 bits, or 16 bytes. This 3D volume texture has a width of two, a height of three, and a depth of four.To calculate the source row pitch and source depth pitch for a given resource, use the following formulas:Source Row Pitch = [size of one element in bytes] * [number of elements in one row] Source Depth Pitch = [Source Row Pitch] * [number of rows (height)]In the case of this example 3D volume texture where the size of each element is 16 bytes, the formulas are as follows:Source Row Pitch = 16 * 2 = 32 Source Depth Pitch = 16 * 2 * 3 = 96The following illustration shows the resource as it is laid out in memory.For example, the following code snippet shows how to specify a destination region in a 2D texture. Assume the destination texture is 512x512 and the operation will copy the data pointed to by pData to  [(120,100)..(200,220)] in the destination texture. Also assume that rowPitch has been initialized with the proper value (as explained above). front and back are set to 0 and 1 respectively, because by having front equal to back, the box is technically empty.<code><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion" /> destRegion;	
            destRegion.left = 120;	
            destRegion.right = 200;	
            destRegion.top = 100;	
            destRegion.bottom = 220;	
            destRegion.front = 0;	
            destRegion.back = 1; pd3dDeviceContext-&gt;UpdateSubresource( pDestTexture, 0, &amp;destRegion, pData, rowPitch, 0 );	
            	
            </code>The 1D case is similar. The following snippet shows how to specify a destination region in a 1D texture. Use the same assumptions as above, except that the texture is 512 in length.<code><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion" /> destRegion;	
            destRegion.left = 120	
            destRegion.right = 200;	
            destRegion.top = 0;	
            destRegion.bottom = 1;	
            destRegion.front = 0;	
            destRegion.back = 1; pd3dDeviceContext-&gt;UpdateSubresource( pDestTexture, 0, &amp;destRegion, pData, rowPitch, 0 );	
            	
            </code>Calling UpdateSubresource on a Deferred ContextIf your application calls UpdateSubresource on a deferred context with a destination box?to which pDstBox points?that has a non-(0,0,0) offset, and if the driver does not support command lists, UpdateSubresource inappropriately applies that destination-box offset to the pSrcData parameter. To work around this behavior, use the following code:<code><see cref="T:SharpDX.Result" /> UpdateSubresource_Workaround( <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device" /> *pDevice, <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext" /> *pDeviceContext, <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource" /> *pDstResource, UINT dstSubresource, const <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion" /> *pDstBox, const void *pSrcData, UINT srcBytesPerElement, UINT srcRowPitch, UINT srcDepthPitch, bool* pDidWorkAround )	
            { <see cref="T:SharpDX.Result" /> hr = <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.Ok" />; bool needWorkaround = false; <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContextType" /> contextType = pDeviceContext-&gt;GetType(); if( pDstBox &amp;&amp; (<see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContextType.Deferred" /> == contextType) ) { <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.FeatureDataThreading" /> threadingCaps = { <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False" />, <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False" /> }; hr = pDevice-&gt;CheckFeatureSupport( <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Feature.Threading" />, &amp;threadingCaps, sizeof(threadingCaps) ); if( SUCCEEDED(hr) ) { if( !threadingCaps.DriverCommandLists ) { needWorkaround = true; } } } const void* pAdjustedSrcData = pSrcData; if( needWorkaround ) { <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion" /> alignedBox = *pDstBox; // convert from pixels to blocks if( m_bBC ) { alignedBox.left     /= 4; alignedBox.right    /= 4; alignedBox.top      /= 4; alignedBox.bottom   /= 4; } pAdjustedSrcData = ((const BYTE*)pSrcData) - (alignedBox.front * srcDepthPitch) - (alignedBox.top * srcRowPitch) - (alignedBox.left * srcBytesPerElement); } pDeviceContext-&gt;UpdateSubresource( pDstResource, dstSubresource, pDstBox, pAdjustedSrcData, srcRowPitch, srcDepthPitch ); if( pDidWorkAround ) { *pDidWorkAround = needWorkaround; } return hr;	
            }

GenerateMips uses the largest mipmap level of the view to recursively generate the lower levels of the mip, stopping with the smallest level specified by the view. If the base resource was not created with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.BindFlags.RenderTarget" /> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.GenerateMipMaps" />, this call has no effect.All video adapters support generating mipmaps if you are using any of the following formats:<code><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.A8_UNorm" /><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R10G10B10A2_UNorm" /><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R11G11B10_Float" /><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R16_Float" /><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R16_SNorm" /><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R16_UNorm" /><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R16G16_Float" /><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R16G16_SNorm" /><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R16G16_UNorm" /><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R16G16B16A16_Float" /><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R16G16B16A16_SNorm" /><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R16G16B16A16_UNorm" /><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32_Float" /><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32_Float" /><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32A32_Float" /><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R8_SNorm" /><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R8_UNorm" /><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R8G8_SNorm" /><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R8G8_UNorm" /><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R8G8B8A8_SNorm" /><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R8G8B8A8_UNorm" /><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R8G8B8A8_UNorm_SRgb" /></code>Some video adapters support generating mipmaps if you are using this format:<code><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_Float" /></code>For all other unsupported formats, this method will silently fail.

            To use a resource with SetResourceMinLOD, you must set the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.ResourceClamp" /> flag when you create that resource.For Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 10.1, when sampling from a texture resource in a shader, the sampler can define a minimum LOD clamp to force sampling from less detailed mip levels.  For Direct3D 11, this functionality is extended from the sampler to the entire resource. Therefore, the application can specify the highest-resolution mip level of a resource that is available for access. This restricts the set of mip levels that are required to be resident in GPU memory, thereby saving memory.The set of mip levels resident per-resource in GPU memory can be specified by the user.Minimum LOD affects all of the resident mip levels. Therefore, only the resident mip levels can be updated and read from.All methods that access texture resources must adhere to minimum LOD clamps.Empty-set accesses are handled as out-of-bounds cases.

Queries that are begun in a device context cannot be manipulated indirectly by executing a command list (that is, Begin or End was invoked against the same query by the deferred context which generated the command list). If such a condition occurs, the ExecuteCommandList method does not execute the command list.

      <summary>	
            Sends queued-up commands in the command buffer to the graphics processing unit (GPU).	
            </summary>
      <remarks>	
            Most applications don't need to call this method. If an application calls this method when not necessary, it incurs a performance penalty.  Each call to Flush incurs a significant amount of overhead.When Microsoft Direct3D state-setting, present, or draw commands are called by an application, those commands are queued into an internal command buffer.  Flush sends those commands to the GPU for processing. Typically, the Direct3D runtime sends these commands to the GPU automatically whenever the runtime determines that  they need to be sent, such as when the command buffer is full or when an application maps a resource. Flush sends the commands manually.We recommend that you use Flush when the CPU waits for an arbitrary amount of time (such as when  you call the Sleep function).Because Flush operates asynchronously,  it can return either before or after the GPU finishes executing the queued graphics commands. However, the graphics commands eventually always complete. You can call the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateQuery(SharpDX.Direct3D11.QueryDescription,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Query)" /> method with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.QueryType.Event" /> value to create an event query; you can then use that event query in a call to the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.GetDataInternal(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous,System.IntPtr,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.AsynchronousFlags)" /> method to determine when the GPU is finished processing the graphics commands.Microsoft Direct3D?11 defers the destruction of objects. Therefore, an application can't rely upon objects immediately being destroyed. By calling Flush, you destroy any  objects whose destruction was deferred.  If an application requires synchronous destruction of an object, we recommend that the application release all its references, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.ClearState" />, and then call Flush.Deferred Destruction Issues with Flip Presentation Swap ChainsDirect3D?11 defers the destruction of objects like views and resources until it can efficiently destroy them. This deferred destruction can cause problems with flip presentation model swap chains. Flip presentation model swap chains have the DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_FLIP_SEQUENTIAL flag set. When you create a flip presentation model swap chain, you can associate only one swap chain at a time with an <see cref="T:System.IntPtr" />, IWindow, or composition surface. If an application attempts to destroy a flip presentation model swap chain and replace it with another swap chain, the original swap chain is not destroyed when the application immediately frees all of the original swap chain's references.Most applications typically use the <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.ResizeBuffers(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.Format,System.Int32)" /> method for the majority of scenarios where they replace new swap chain buffers for old swap chain buffers. However, if an application must actually destroy an old swap chain and create a new swap chain, the application must force the destruction of all objects that the application freed. To force the destruction, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.ClearState" /> (or otherwise ensure no views are bound to pipeline state), and then call Flush on the immediate context. You must force destruction before you call IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForHwnd, IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForImmersiveWindow, or IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForCompositionSurface again to create a new swap chain.

      <remarks>	
            The maximum number of active render targets a device can have active at any given time is set by a #define in D3D11.h called  D3D11_SIMULTANEOUS_RENDER_TARGET_COUNT. It is invalid to try to set the same subresource to multiple render target slots.  Any render targets not defined by this call are set to <c>null</c>.If any subresources are also currently bound for reading in a different stage or writing (perhaps in a different part of the pipeline),  those bind points will be set to <c>null</c>, in order to prevent the same subresource from being read and written simultaneously in a single rendering operation.The method will hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. This differs from the device state behavior in Direct3D 10.If the render-target views were created from an array resource type, then all of the render-target views must have the same array size.   This restriction also applies to the depth-stencil view, its array size must match that of the render-target views being bound.The pixel shader must be able to simultaneously render to at least eight separate render targets. All of these render targets must access the same type of resource: Buffer, Texture1D, Texture1DArray, Texture2D, Texture2DArray, Texture3D, or TextureCube. All render targets must have the same size in all dimensions (width and height, and depth for 3D or array size for *Array types). If render targets use multisample anti-aliasing, all bound render targets and depth buffer must be the same form of multisample resource (that is, the sample counts must be the same). Each render target can have a different data format. These render target formats are not required to have identical bit-per-element counts.Any combination of the eight slots for render targets can have a render target set or not set.The same resource view cannot be bound to multiple render target slots simultaneously. However, you can set multiple non-overlapping resource views of a single resource as simultaneous multiple render targets.

      <remarks>	
            For pixel shaders, the render targets and unordered-access views share the same resource slots when being written out. This means that UAVs must be  given an offset so that they are placed in the slots after the render target views that are being bound.Note??RTVs, DSV, and UAVs cannot be set independently; they all need to be set at the same time.Two RTVs conflict if they share a subresource (and therefore share the same resource).Two UAVs conflict if they share a subresource (and therefore share the same resource).An RTV conflicts with a UAV if they share a subresource or share a bind point.OMSetRenderTargetsAndUnorderedAccessViews operates properly in the following situations:<para>NumViews != D3D11_KEEP_RENDER_TARGETS_AND_DEPTH_STENCIL and NumUAVs != D3D11_KEEP_UNORDERED_ACCESS_VIEWS</para><para>The following conditions must be true for OMSetRenderTargetsAndUnorderedAccessViews to succeed and for the runtime to pass the bind information to the driver:</para>

      <remarks>	
            For pixel shaders, the render targets and unordered-access views share the same resource slots when being written out. This means that UAVs must be  given an offset so that they are placed in the slots after the render target views that are being bound.Note??RTVs, DSV, and UAVs cannot be set independently; they all need to be set at the same time.Two RTVs conflict if they share a subresource (and therefore share the same resource).Two UAVs conflict if they share a subresource (and therefore share the same resource).An RTV conflicts with a UAV if they share a subresource or share a bind point.OMSetRenderTargetsAndUnorderedAccessViews operates properly in the following situations:<para>NumViews != D3D11_KEEP_RENDER_TARGETS_AND_DEPTH_STENCIL and NumUAVs != D3D11_KEEP_UNORDERED_ACCESS_VIEWS</para><para>The following conditions must be true for OMSetRenderTargetsAndUnorderedAccessViews to succeed and for the runtime to pass the bind information to the driver:</para>

      <remarks>	
            Blend state is used by the output-merger stage to determine how to blend together two pixel values. The two values are commonly the current pixel value and the pixel value already in the output render target. Use the blend operation to control where the two pixel values come from and how they are mathematically combined.To create a blend-state interface, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateBlendState(SharpDX.Direct3D11.BlendStateDescription@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.BlendState)" />.Passing in <c>null</c> for the blend-state interface indicates to the runtime to set a default blending state.  The following table indicates the default blending parameters.StateDefault Value AlphaToCoverageEnableFALSE BlendEnableFALSE[8] SrcBlendD3D11_BLEND_ONE DstBlendD3D11_BLEND_ZERO BlendOpD3D11_BLEND_OP_ADD SrcBlendAlphaD3D11_BLEND_ONE DstBlendAlphaD3D11_BLEND_ZERO BlendOpAlphaD3D11_BLEND_OP_ADD RenderTargetWriteMask[8]<see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ColorWriteMaskFlags.All" />[8]?A sample mask determines which samples get updated in all the active render targets. The mapping of bits in a sample mask to samples in a multisample render target is the responsibility of an individual application. A sample mask is always applied; it is independent of whether multisampling is enabled, and does not depend on whether an application uses multisample render targets.The method will hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. This differs from the device state behavior in Direct3D 10.

      <remarks>	
            An effect uses memory space two different ways: to store the information required by the runtime to execute an effect, and to store the metadata  required to reflect information back to an application using the API. You can minimize the amount of memory required by an effect by  calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Effect.Optimize" /> which removes the reflection metadata from memory. API methods to read variables will no  longer work once reflection data has been removed.The following methods will fail after Optimize has been called on an effect.<see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Effect.GetConstantBufferByIndex(System.Int32)" /><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Effect.GetConstantBufferByName(System.String)" /><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Effect.GetDescription(SharpDX.Direct3D11.EffectDescription@)" /><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Effect.GetDevice(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device@)" /><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Effect.GetTechniqueByIndex(System.Int32)" /><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Effect.GetTechniqueByName(System.String)" /><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Effect.GetVariableByIndex(System.Int32)" /><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Effect.GetVariableByName(System.String)" /><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Effect.GetVariableBySemantic(System.String)" />Note??References retrieved with these methods before calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Effect.Optimize" /> are still valid  after <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Effect.Optimize" /> is called.  This allows the application to get all the variables, techniques, and passes it will use,  call Optimize, and then use the effect.Note??The DirectX SDK does not supply any compiled binaries for effects.

            </summary>
      <remarks>	
            In general, binding flags can be combined using a logical OR (except the constant-buffer flag); however, you should use a single flag to allow the device to optimize the resource usage.This enumeration is used by a:Buffer description when creating a buffer. Texture description when creating a texture (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture1DDescription" /> or <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2DDescription" /> or <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture3DDescription" />).A shader-resource buffer is NOT a constant buffer; rather, it is a texture or buffer resource that is bound to a shader, that contains texture or buffer data (it is not limited to a single element type in the buffer). A shader-resource buffer is created with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.BindFlags.ShaderResource" /> flag and is bound to the pipeline using one of these APIs: <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.GeometryShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.IntPtr)" />, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.PixelShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.IntPtr)" />, or <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VertexShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.IntPtr)" />. Furthermore, a shader-resource buffer cannot use the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteNoOverwrite" /> flag.

            A comparison option determines whether how the runtime compares source (new) data against destination (existing) data before storing the new data. The comparison option is declared in a description before an object is created. The API allows you to set a comparison option for a depth-stencil buffer (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DepthStencilStateDescription" />), depth-stencil operations (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DepthStencilOperationDescription" />), or sampler state (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.SamplerStateDescription" />).

            D3DX11 automatically performs gamma correction (to convert color data from RGB space to standard RGB space) when loading texture data.

Use the SRGB filter flags to indicate if the data does not need to be converted into sRGB space.

            Identifies a resource to be accessed for reading and writing by the CPU. Applications may combine one or more of these flags.	
            </summary>
      <remarks>	
            This enumeration is used in <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.MapSubresource(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture1D,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode,SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapFlags,SharpDX.DataStream@)" />.These remarks are divided into the following topics:Meaning CommonMeaning of <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteNoOverwrite" />D3D11_MAP_WRITE_NO_OVERWRITE signifies that the application promises not to write to data that the input assembler (IA) stage is using. In exchange, the GPU allows the application to write to other parts of the same buffer.  The application must ensure that it does not write over any data in use by the IA stage.For example, consider the buffer illustrated in the following diagram. If a Draw call has been issued that uses vertices 4-6, then an application that calls Map on this buffer must ensure that it does not write to the vertices that the Draw call will access during rendering.However, ensuring this can be difficult, because the GPU is often many frames behind the CPU in terms of which frame it is currently processing. Keeping track of which sections of a resource are being used because of calls made 2 to 5 frames ago is difficult and error-prone. Because of this, it is recommended that applications only write to the uninitialized portions of a resource when using <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteNoOverwrite" />.Common Usage of <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteDiscard" /> with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteNoOverwrite" />D3D11_MAP_WRITE_DISCARD and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteNoOverwrite" /> are normally used in conjunction with dynamic index/vertex buffers. <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteDiscard" /> can also be used with dynamic textures. However, <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteNoOverwrite" /> cannot be used with dynamic textures.A common use of these two flags involves filling dynamic index/vertex buffers with geometry that can be seen from the camera's current position. The first time that data is entered into the buffer on a given frame, Map is called with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteDiscard" />; doing so invalidates the previous contents of the buffer. The buffer is then filled with all available data.Subsequent writes to the buffer within the same frame should use <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteNoOverwrite" />. This will enable the CPU to access a resource that is potentially being used by the GPU as long as the restrictions described previously are respected.

Therefore, do not use them together. <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.ResourceClamp" /> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.GdiCompatible" /> are mutually exclusive. Therefore, do not use them together. You must bind the texture as a render target for the output-merger stage. For example, set the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.BindFlags.RenderTarget" /> flag in the BindFlags member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2DDescription" /> structure. You must set the maximum number of MIP map levels to 1. For example, set the MipLevels member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2DDescription" /> structure to 1. You must specify that the texture requires read and write access by the GPU. For example, set the Usage member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2DDescription" /> structure to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Default" />.  <para>You must set the texture format to one of the following types. </para><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm" /><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_Typeless" /><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm_SRgb" />	
             For example, set the Format member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2DDescription" /> structure to one of these  types. You cannot use <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.GdiCompatible" /> with multisampling. Therefore, set the Count member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SampleDescription" /> structure to 1. Then, set the SampleDesc member of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2DDescription" /> structure to this <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SampleDescription" /> structure.

            Identifies expected resource use during rendering. The usage directly reflects whether a resource is accessible by the CPU and/or the graphics processing unit (GPU).	
            </summary>
      <remarks>	
            An application identifies the way a resource is intended to be used (its usage) in a resource description. There are several structures for creating resources including: <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture1DDescription" />, <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2DDescription" />, <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture3DDescription" />, <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.BufferDescription" />.<para>Differences between Direct3D 9 and Direct3D 10/11:</para><para>In Direct3D 9, you specify the type of memory a resource should be created in at resource creation time (using <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D9.Pool" />). It was an application's job to decide what memory pool would provide the best combination of functionality and performance.</para><para>In Direct3D 10/11, an application no longer specifies what type of memory (the pool) to create a resource in. Instead, you specify the intended usage of the resource, and let the runtime (in concert with the driver and a memory manager) choose the type of memory that will achieve the best performance.</para>?Resource Usage RestrictionsEach usage dictates a tradeoff between accessibility for the CPU and accessibility for the GPU. In general, higher-performance access for one of these two processors means lower-performance access for the other. At either extreme are the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Default" /> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Staging" /> usages. <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Default" /> restricts access almost entirely to the GPU. <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Staging" /> restricts access almost entirely to the CPU and allows only a data transfer (copy) of a resource between the GPU and the CPU. You can perform these copy operations via the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopySubresourceRegion_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion})" /> and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopyResource_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource)" /> methods. You can also use these copy methods to copy data between two resources of the same usage. You can also use the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.UpdateSubresource(SharpDX.DataBox,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32)" /> method to copy memory directly from a CPU-supplied reference to any resource, most usefully a resource with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Default" />.D3D11_USAGE_DYNAMIC usage is a special case that optimizes the flow of data from CPU to GPU when the CPU generates that data on-the-fly and sends that data with high frequency. <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Dynamic" /> is typically used on resources with vertex data and on constant buffers. Use the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.MapSubresource(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture1D,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode,SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapFlags,SharpDX.DataStream@)" /> and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.UnmapSubresource(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32)" /> methods to write data to these resources. To achieve the highest performance for data consumed serially, like vertex data, use the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteNoOverwrite" /> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteDiscard" /> sequence. For more info about this sequence, see Common Usage of <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteDiscard" /> with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteNoOverwrite" />.D3D11_USAGE_IMMUTABLE usage is another special case that causes the GPU to generate data just once when you create a resource. <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Immutable" /> is well-suited to data such as textures because such data is typically read into memory from some file format. Therefore, when you create a texture with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Immutable" />, the GPU directly reads that texture into memory.Use the following table to choose the usage that best describes how the resource will need to be accessed by the CPU and/or the GPU. Of course, there will be performance tradeoffs.Resource UsageDefaultDynamicImmutableStaging GPU-Readyesyesyesyes1 GPU-Writeyesyes1 CPU-Readyes1 CPU-Writeyesyes1?1 - GPU read or write of a resource with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Staging" /> usage is restricted to copy operations. You use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopySubresourceRegion_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion})" /> and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopyResource_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource)" /> for these copy operations. Also, because depth-stencil formats and multisample layouts are implementation details of a particular GPU design, the operating system can?t expose these formats and layouts to the CPU in general. Therefore, staging resources can't be a depth-stencil buffer or a multisampled render target.Note??You can technically use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.UpdateSubresource(SharpDX.DataBox,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32)" /> to copy to a resource with any usage except <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Immutable" />. However, we recommend to use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.UpdateSubresource(SharpDX.DataBox,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32)" /> to update only a resource with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Default" />. We recommend to use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.MapSubresource(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture1D,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode,SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapFlags,SharpDX.DataStream@)" /> and <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.UnmapSubresource(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32)" /> to update resources with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Dynamic" /> because that is the specific purpose of <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Dynamic" /> resources, and is therefore the most optimized path.Note??<see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Dynamic" /> resources consume specific hardware capabilities. Therefore, use them sparingly. The display driver typically allocates memory for <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Dynamic" /> resources with a caching algorithm that favors CPU writes and hinders CPU reads. Furthermore, the memory behind <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Dynamic" /> resources might not even be the same for successive calls to <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.MapSubresource(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture1D,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode,SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapFlags,SharpDX.DataStream@)" />. Therefore, do not expect high performance or even consistent CPU reads from <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Dynamic" /> resources.Note??<see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopyStructureCount(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.UnorderedAccessView)" /> is a special case of GPU-to-CPU copy. Use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopyStructureCount(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.UnorderedAccessView)" /> only with unordered access views (UAVs) of buffers.Resource Bind OptionsTo maximize performance, not all resource usage options can be used as input or output resources to the pipeline. This table identifies these limitations.Resource Can Be Bound AsDefaultDynamicImmutableStaging Input to a Stageyes2yes3yes Output from a Stageyes2?2 - If bound as an input and an output using different views, each view must use different subresources. 3 - The resource can only be created with a single subresource. The resource cannot be a texture array. The resource cannot be a mipmap chain.

            D3DX11SaveTextureToFile writes out the extra DDS_HEADER_DXT10 structure for the input texture only if necessary (for example, because the input texture is in standard RGB (sRGB) format). If <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.D3DX11.SaveTextureToFile(SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,SharpDX.Direct3D11.ImageFileFormat,System.String)" /> writes out the DDS_HEADER_DXT10 structure, it sets the dwFourCC member of the DDS_PIXELFORMAT structure for the texture to DX10 to indicate the prescense of the DDS_HEADER_DXT10 extended header.

            The method will hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. This differs from the device state behavior in Direct3D 10.The Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available starting with Windows Developer Preview, can bind a larger number of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer" /> resources to the shader than the maximum constant buffer size that is supported by shaders (4096 constants ? 4*32-bit components each).  When you bind such a large buffer, the shader can access only the first 4096 4*32-bit component constants in the buffer, as if 4096 constants is the full size of the buffer.If the application wants the shader to access other parts of the buffer, it must call the DSSetConstantBuffers1 method instead.

      <remarks>	
            The method will hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. This differs from the device state behavior in Direct3D 10.You can't use the <see cref="T:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.ConstantBuffer" /> interface to get information about what is currently bound to the pipeline in the device context. But you can use <see cref="T:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.ConstantBuffer" /> to get information from a compiled shader. For example, you can use <see cref="T:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.ConstantBuffer" /> and <see cref="T:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.ShaderReflectionVariable" /> to determine the slot in which a geometry shader expects a constant buffer. You can then pass this slot number to GSSetConstantBuffers to set the constant buffer. You can call the D3D11Reflect function to retrieve the address of a reference to the <see cref="T:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.ShaderReflection" /> interface and then call <see cref="M:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.ShaderReflection.GetConstantBuffer(System.Int32)" /> to get a reference to <see cref="T:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.ConstantBuffer" />.The Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available starting with Windows Developer Preview, can bind a larger number of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer" /> resources to the shader than the maximum constant buffer size that is supported by shaders (4096 constants ? 4*32-bit components each).  When you bind such a large buffer, the shader can access only the first 4096 4*32-bit component constants in the buffer, as if 4096 constants is the full size of the buffer.If the application wants the shader to access other parts of the buffer, it must call the GSSetConstantBuffers1 method instead.

            The method will hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. This differs from the device state behavior in Direct3D 10.The Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available starting with Windows Developer Preview, can bind a larger number of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer" /> resources to the shader than the maximum constant buffer size that is supported by shaders (4096 constants ? 4*32-bit components each).  When you bind such a large buffer, the shader can access only the first 4096 4*32-bit component constants in the buffer, as if 4096 constants is the full size of the buffer.If the application wants the shader to access other parts of the buffer, it must call the HSSetConstantBuffers1 method instead.

            This method does not remove any messages from the message queue.This method gets messages from the message queue after an optional retrieval filter has been applied.Applications should call this method twice to retrieve a message - first to obtain the size of the message and second to get the message. Here is a typical example:<code>	
             // Get the size of the message	
            <see cref="T:SharpDX.PointerSize" /> messageLength = 0;	
            <see cref="T:SharpDX.Result" /> hr = pInfoQueue-&gt;GetMessage(0, <c>null</c>, &amp;messageLength); // Allocate space and get the message	
            <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Message" /> * pMessage = (<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Message" />*)malloc(messageLength);	
            hr = pInfoQueue-&gt;GetMessage(0, pMessage, &amp;messageLength);	
            	
            </code>For an overview see Information Queue Overview.

            The method will hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. This differs from the device state behavior in Direct3D 10.The Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available on Windows Developer Preview and later operating systems, can bind a larger number of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer" /> resources to the shader than the maximum constant buffer size that is supported by shaders (4096 constants ? 4*32-bit components each).  When you bind such a large buffer, the shader can access only the first 4096 4*32-bit component constants in the buffer, as if 4096 constants is the full size of the buffer.If the application wants the shader to access other parts of the buffer, it must call the PSSetConstantBuffers1 method instead.

            The method will hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. This differs from the device state behavior in Direct3D 10.The Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available starting with Windows Developer Preview, can bind a larger number of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer" /> resources to the shader than the maximum constant buffer size that is supported by shaders (4096 constants ? 4*32-bit components each).  When you bind such a large buffer, the shader can access only the first 4096 4*32-bit component constants in the buffer, as if 4096 constants is the full size of the buffer.If the application wants the shader to access other parts of the buffer, it must call the VSSetConstantBuffers1 method instead.

            </summary>
      <remarks>	
            A view is a format-specific way to look at the data in a resource. The view determines what data to look at, and how it is cast when read.When viewing a resource, the resource-view description must specify a typed format, that is compatible with the resource format. So that means that you cannot create a resource-view description using any format with _TYPELESS in the name. You can however view a typeless resource by specifying a typed format for the view. For example, a <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_Typeless" /> resource can be viewed with one of these typed formats: <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_Float" />, <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_UInt" />, and <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_SInt" />, since these typed formats are compatible with the typeless resource.Create a shader-resource-view description by calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateShaderResourceView(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceViewDescription},SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceView)" />. To view a shader-resource-view description, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceView.GetDescription(SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceViewDescription@)" />.

            This structure is one member of a shader-resource-view description (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceViewDescription" />).As an example, assuming MostDetailedMip = 6 and MipLevels = 2, the view will have access to 2 mipmap levels, 6 and 7, of the original texture for which <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateShaderResourceView(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceViewDescription},SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceView)" /> creates the view. In this situation, MostDetailedMip is greater than the MipLevels in the view. However, MostDetailedMip is not greater than the MipLevels in the original resource.

For example, if you use Microsoft Direct3D?10 hardware at feature level 10 (<see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel.Level_10_0" />) and call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.D3D11.CreateDevice(SharpDX.DXGI.Adapter,SharpDX.Direct3D.DriverType,System.IntPtr,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceCreationFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel[],System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext@)" /> to create an <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device" />, you must constrain the maximum texture size to <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Resource.MaximumTexture3DSize" /> (2048) when you create your 3D texture.

              Direct3D 11 supports fractional viewports; the parameter types are  floating-point numbers. The feature level, <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel.Level_11_0" />, supports (D3D11_VIEWPORT_BOUNDS_MIN, D3D11_VIEWPORT_BOUNDS_MAX) values between (-32768, 32,767). Direct3D 10 does not support fractional viewports. The feature levels, <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel.Level_10_1" /> (or below), supports (D3D10_VIEWPORT_BOUNDS_MIN, D3D10_VIEWPORT_BOUNDS_MAX) values between (-16384, 16383).?

      <remarks>
            This method performs a ray vs ray intersection test based on the following formula
            from Goldman.
            <code>s = det([o_2 - o_1, d_2, d_1 x d_2]) / ||d_1 x d_2||^2</code><code>t = det([o_2 - o_1, d_1, d_1 x d_2]) / ||d_1 x d_2||^2</code>
            Where o_1 is the position of the first ray, o_2 is the position of the second ray,
            d_1 is the normalized direction of the first ray, d_2 is the normalized direction
            of the second ray, det denotes the determinant of a matrix, x denotes the cross
            product, [ ] denotes a matrix, and || || denotes the length or magnitude of a vector.

      <remarks>
            This method tests if the ray intersects either the front or back of the triangle.
            If the ray is parallel to the triangle's plane, no intersection is assumed to have
            happened. If the intersection of the ray and the triangle is behind the origin of
            the ray, no intersection is assumed to have happened. In both cases of assumptions,
            this method returns false.

            Use the  <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.InputAssemblerStage.SetPrimitiveTopology" /> method and a value from <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D.PrimitiveTopology" /> to bind a primitive topology to the input-assembler stage. Use the  <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.InputAssemblerStage.GetPrimitiveTopology" /> method to retrieve the primitive topology for the input-assembler stage.The following diagram shows the various primitive types for a geometry shader object.

            This method reads bytes from this stream object into memory. The stream object must be opened in STGM_READ mode. This method adjusts the seek reference by the actual number of bytes read.The number of bytes actually read is also returned in the pcbRead parameter.Notes to CallersThe actual number of bytes read can be less than the number of bytes requested if an error occurs or if the end of the stream is reached during the read operation.  The number of bytes returned should always  be compared to the number of bytes requested.  If the number of bytes returned is less than the number of bytes requested, it usually means the Read method attempted to read  past the end of the stream.The application should handle both a returned error  and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.Ok" /> return values on end-of-stream read operations.

      <remarks>	
            ISequentialStream::Write writes the specified data to a stream object. The seek reference is adjusted for the number of bytes actually written. The number of bytes actually written is returned in the pcbWritten parameter. If the byte count is zero bytes, the write operation has no effect.If the seek reference is currently past the end of the stream and the byte count is nonzero, this method increases the size of the stream to the seek reference and writes the specified bytes starting at the seek reference. The fill bytes written to the stream are not initialized to any particular value. This is the same as the end-of-file behavior in the MS-DOS FAT file system.With a zero byte count and a seek reference past the end of the stream, this method does not create the fill bytes to increase the stream to the seek reference. In this case, you must call the 	
            <see cref="M:SharpDX.Win32.IStream.SetSize(System.Int64)" /> method to increase the size of the stream and write the fill bytes.The pcbWritten parameter can have a value even if an error occurs.In the COM-provided implementation, stream objects are not sparse. Any fill bytes are eventually allocated on the disk and assigned to the stream.

It is an error to seek before the beginning of the stream. It is not, however, an error to seek past the end of the stream. Seeking past the end of the stream is useful for subsequent write operations, as the stream byte range will be extended to the new seek position immediately before the write is complete.You can also use this method to obtain the current value of the seek reference by calling this method with the dwOrigin parameter set to STREAM_SEEK_CUR and the dlibMove parameter set to 0 so that the seek reference is not changed. The current seek reference is returned in the plibNewPosition parameter.

      <remarks>	
            IStream::SetSize changes the size of the stream object. Call this method to preallocate space for the stream. If the libNewSize parameter is larger than the current stream size, the stream is extended to the indicated size by filling the intervening space with bytes of undefined value. This operation is similar to the 	
            <see cref="M:SharpDX.Win32.IStreamBase.Write(System.IntPtr,System.Int32)" /> method if the seek reference is past the current end of stream.If the libNewSize parameter is smaller than the current stream, the stream is truncated to the indicated size.The seek reference is not affected by the change in stream size.Calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.Win32.IStream.SetSize(System.Int64)" /> can be an effective way to obtain a large chunk of contiguous space.

            The CopyTo method copies the specified bytes from one stream to another. It can also be used to copy a stream to itself. The seek reference in each stream instance is adjusted for the number of bytes read or written. This method is equivalent to reading cb bytes into memory using 	
            <see cref="M:SharpDX.Win32.IStreamBase.Read(System.IntPtr,System.Int32)" /> and then immediately writing them to the destination stream using

            <see cref="M:SharpDX.Win32.IStream.Clone" /> method.If <see cref="!:SharpDX.Win32.IStream.CopyTo_" /> returns an error, you cannot assume that the seek references are valid for either the source or destination. Additionally, the values of pcbRead and pcbWritten are not meaningful even though they are returned.If <see cref="!:SharpDX.Win32.IStream.CopyTo_" /> returns successfully, the actual number of bytes read and written are the same.To copy the remainder of the source from the current seek reference, specify the maximum large integer value for the cb parameter. If the seek reference is the beginning of the stream, this operation copies the entire stream.

      <remarks>	
            The Commit method ensures that changes to a stream object opened in transacted mode are reflected in the parent storage. Changes that have been made to the stream since it was opened or last committed are reflected to the parent storage object. If the parent is opened in transacted mode, the parent may revert at a later time, rolling back the changes to this stream object. The compound file implementation does not support the opening of streams in transacted mode, so this method has very little effect other than to flush memory buffers. For more information, see 	
            <see cref="T:SharpDX.Win32.IStream" /> - Compound File Implementation.If the stream is open in direct mode, this method ensures that any memory buffers have been flushed out to the underlying storage object. This is much like a flush in traditional file systems.The <see cref="M:SharpDX.Win32.IStream.Commit(SharpDX.Win32.CommitFlags)" /> method is useful on a direct mode stream when the implementation of the 	
            <see cref="T:SharpDX.Win32.IStream" /> interface is a wrapper for underlying file system APIs. In this case, <see cref="M:SharpDX.Win32.IStream.Commit(SharpDX.Win32.CommitFlags)" /> would be connected to the file system's flush call.

      <remarks>	
            The byte range of the stream can be extended.  Locking an extended range for the stream is useful as a method of communication between different instances of the stream without changing data that is actually part of the stream.Three types of locking can be supported: locking to exclude other writers, locking to exclude other readers or writers, and locking that allows only one requester to obtain a lock on the given range, which is usually an alias for one of the other two lock types. A given stream instance might support either of the first two types, or both. The lock type is specified by dwLockType, using a value from the 	
            <see cref="T:SharpDX.Win32.LockType" /> enumeration.Any region locked with <see cref="M:SharpDX.Win32.IStream.LockRegion(System.Int64,System.Int64,SharpDX.Win32.LockType)" /> must later be explicitly unlocked by calling 	
            <see cref="M:SharpDX.Win32.IStream.UnlockRegion(System.Int64,System.Int64,SharpDX.Win32.LockType)" /> with exactly the same values for the libOffset, cb, and dwLockType parameters. The region must be unlocked before the stream is released. Two adjacent regions cannot be locked separately and then unlocked with a single unlock call.Notes to CallersSince the type of locking supported is optional and can vary in different implementations of 	
            <see cref="T:SharpDX.Win32.IStream" />, you must provide code to deal with the STG_E_INVALIDFUNCTION error.The LockRegion method has no effect in the compound file implementation, because the implementation does not support range locking.Notes to ImplementersSupport for this method is optional for implementations of stream objects since it may not be supported by the underlying file system. The type of locking supported is also optional. The STG_E_INVALIDFUNCTION error is returned if the requested type of locking is not supported.

      <remarks>Distance squared is the value before taking the square root. 
            Distance squared can often be used in place of distance if relative comparisons are being made. 
            For example, consider three points A, B, and C. To determine whether B or C is further from A, 
            compare the distance between A and B to the distance between A and C. Calculating the two distances 
            involves two square roots, which are computationally expensive. However, using distance squared 
            provides the same information and avoids calculating two square roots.

      <remarks>Distance squared is the value before taking the square root. 
            Distance squared can often be used in place of distance if relative comparisons are being made. 
            For example, consider three points A, B, and C. To determine whether B or C is further from A, 
            compare the distance between A and B to the distance between A and C. Calculating the two distances 
            involves two square roots, which are computationally expensive. However, using distance squared 
            provides the same information and avoids calculating two square roots.

      <remarks>Distance squared is the value before taking the square root. 
            Distance squared can often be used in place of distance if relative comparisons are being made. 
            For example, consider three points A, B, and C. To determine whether B or C is further from A, 
            compare the distance between A and B to the distance between A and C. Calculating the two distances 
            involves two square roots, which are computationally expensive. However, using distance squared 
            provides the same information and avoids calculating two square roots.

            SetPrivateData makes a copy of the specified data and stores it with the object.Private data that SetPrivateData stores in the object occupies the same storage space as private data that is stored by associated Direct3D objects (for example, by a Microsoft Direct3D?11 device through <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.SetPrivateData" /> or by a Direct3D?11 child device through <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceChild.SetPrivateData" />).The debug layer reports memory leaks by outputting a list of object interface references along with their friendly names. The default friendly name is "&lt;unnamed&gt;". You can set the friendly name so that you can determine if the corresponding object interface reference caused the leak. To set the friendly name, use the SetPrivateData method and the well-known private data <see cref="T:System.Guid" /> (<see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.CommonGuid.DebugObjectName" />) that is in D3Dcommon.h. For example, to give pContext a friendly name of My name, use the following code:<code>	
             static const char c_szName[] = "My name";	
            hr = pContext-&gt;SetPrivateData( <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.CommonGuid.DebugObjectName" />, sizeof( c_szName ) - 1, c_szName );	
            	
            </code>You can use <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.CommonGuid.DebugObjectName" /> to track down memory leaks and understand performance characteristics of your applications. This information is reflected in the output of the debug layer that is related to memory leaks (<see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Debug.ReportLiveDeviceObjects" />) and with the event tracing for Windows events that we've added to Windows Developer Preview.

The following are the critical steps involved.Graphics driver model determination ? Because DXGI is only available on systems with WDDM drivers, the application must first confirm the driver model by using the following API.

            Graphics applications can use the DXGI API to retrieve an accurate set of graphics memory  values on systems that have WDDM drivers. The following are the critical steps involved.Graphics driver model determination ? Because DXGI is only available on systems with WDDM drivers, the application must first confirm the driver model by using the following API.  	
            <code>

      <remarks>	
            The CreateSurface method creates a buffer to exchange data between one or more devices. It is used internally, and you should not directly call it.The runtime automatically creates an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface" /> interface when it creates a Direct3D resource object that represents a surface. For example, the runtime creates an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface" /> interface when it calls <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateTexture2D" /> or <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device.CreateTexture2D" /> to create a 2D texture. To retrieve the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface" /> interface that represents the 2D texture surface, call ID3D11Texture2D::QueryInterface or ID3D10Texture2D::QueryInterface. In this call, you must pass the identifier of <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface" />. If the 2D texture has only a single MIP-map level and does not consist of an array of textures, QueryInterface succeeds and returns a reference to the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface" /> interface reference. Otherwise, QueryInterface fails and does not return the reference to <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface" />.

            The values for the Priority parameter function as follows:Positive values increase the likelihood that the GPU scheduler will grant GPU execution cycles to the device when rendering. Negative values lessen the likelihood that the device will receive GPU execution cycles when devices compete for them. The device is guaranteed to receive some GPU execution cycles at all settings.To use the SetGPUThreadPriority method, you should have a comprehensive understanding of GPU scheduling. You should profile your application to ensure that it behaves as intended. If used inappropriately, the SetGPUThreadPriority method can impede rendering speed and result in a poor user experience.

      <remarks>	
            A software adapter is a DLL that implements the entirety of a device driver interface, plus emulation, if necessary, of kernel-mode graphics components for Windows. Details on implementing a software adapter can be found in the Windows Vista Driver Development Kit. This is a very complex development task, and is not recommended for general readers. Calling this method will increment the module's reference count by one. The reference count can be decremented by calling {{FreeLibrary}}. The typical calling scenario is to call {{LoadLibrary}}, pass the handle to CreateSoftwareAdapter, then immediately call {{FreeLibrary}} on the DLL and forget the DLL's {{HMODULE}}. Since the software adapter calls FreeLibrary when it is destroyed, the lifetime of the DLL will now be owned by the adapter, and the application is free of any further consideration of its lifetime.

      <remarks>	
            When you create a factory, the factory enumerates the set of adapters that are available in the system. Therefore, if you change the adapters in a system, you must destroy  and recreate the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory" /> object. The number of adapters in a system changes when you add or remove a display card, or dock or undock a laptop.When the EnumAdapters method succeeds and fills the ppAdapter parameter with the address of the reference to the adapter interface, EnumAdapters increments the adapter interface's reference count. When you finish using the  adapter interface, call the Release method to decrement the reference count before you destroy the reference.EnumAdapters first returns the local adapter with the output on which the desktop primary is displayed. This adapter corresponds with an index of zero. EnumAdapters then returns other adapters with outputs.

      <returns>if WindowHandle is invalid, or E_OUTOFMEMORY.</returns>
      <remarks>	
            The combination of WindowHandle and Flags informs DXGI to stop monitoring window messages for the previously-associated window.If the application switches to full-screen mode, DXGI will choose a full-screen resolution to be the smallest supported resolution that is larger or the same size as the current back buffer size.Applications can make some changes to make the transition from windowed to full screen more efficient. For example, on a WM_SIZE message, the application should release any outstanding swap-chain back buffers, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.ResizeBuffers(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.Format,System.Int32)" />, then re-acquire the back buffers from the swap chain(s). This gives the swap chain(s) an opportunity to resize the back buffers, and/or recreate them to enable full-screen flipping operation. If the application does not perform this sequence, DXGI will still make the full-screen/windowed transition, but may be forced to use a stretch operation (since the back buffers may not be the correct size), which may be less efficient. Even if a stretch is not required, presentation may not be optimal because the back buffers might not be directly interchangeable with the front buffer. Thus, a call to ResizeBuffers on WM_SIZE is always recommended, since WM_SIZE is always sent during a fullscreen transition.While windowed, the application can, if it chooses, restrict the size of its window's client area to sizes to which it is comfortable rendering. A fully flexible application would make no such restriction, but UI elements or other design considerations can, of course, make this flexibility untenable. If the application further chooses to restrict its window's client area to just those that match supported full-screen resolutions, the application can field WM_SIZING, then check against <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Output.FindClosestMatchingMode(SharpDX.DXGI.ModeDescription@,SharpDX.DXGI.ModeDescription@,SharpDX.ComObject)" />. If a matching mode is found, allow the resize. (The <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Output" /> can be retrieved from <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.GetContainingOutput(SharpDX.DXGI.Output@)" />. Absent subsequent changes to desktop topology, this will be the same output that will be chosen when alt-enter is fielded and fullscreen mode is begun for that swap chain.)Applications that want to handle mode changes or Alt+Enter themselves should call MakeWindowAssociation with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.WindowAssociationFlags.IgnoreAll" /> flag after swap chain creation. The WindowHandle argument, if non-<c>null</c>, specifies that the application message queues will not be handled by the DXGI runtime for all swap chains of a particular target <see cref="T:System.IntPtr" />.  Calling MakeWindowAssociation with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.WindowAssociationFlags.IgnoreAll" /> flag after swapchain creation ensures that DXGI will not interfere with application's handling of window mode changes or Alt+Enter.Notes for Metro style appsIf a Metro style app calls MakeWindowAssociation, it fails with <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.DXGIError.NotCurrentlyAvailable" />.A Microsoft Win32 application can use MakeWindowAssociation to control full-screen transitions through the Alt+Enter key combination and print screen behavior for full screen.  For Metro style apps, because DXGI cannot perform full-screen transitions, Metro style app have no way to control full-screen transitions.

      <remarks>	
            If you attempt to create a swap chain in full-screen mode, and full-screen mode is unavailable, the swap chain will be created in windowed mode and <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.DXGIStatus.Occluded" /> will be returned.If the buffer width or the buffer height is zero, the sizes will be inferred from the output window size in the swap-chain description.Because the target output cannot be chosen explicitly when the swap-chain is created, you should not create a full-screen swap chain. This can reduce presentation performance if the swap chain size and the output window size do not match. Here are two ways to ensure that the sizes match:Create a windowed swap chain and then set it full-screen using <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.SetFullscreenState(System.Boolean,SharpDX.DXGI.Output)" />. Save a reference to the swap chain immediately after creation, and use it to get the output window size during a WM_SIZE event. Then resize the swap chain buffers (with <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.ResizeBuffers(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.Format,System.Int32)" />) during the transition from windowed to full-screen.If the swap chain is in full-screen mode, before you release it you must use SetFullscreenState to switch it to windowed mode. For more information about releasing a swap chain, see the "Destroying a Swap Chain" section of DXGI Overview.You can specify <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect" /> and <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFlags" /> values in the swap-chain description that pDesc points to. These values allow you to use features like flip-model presentation and content protection by using pre-Windows Developer Preview APIs.However, to use stereo presentation and to change resize behavior for the flip model, applications must use the IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForHwnd method. Otherwise, the back-buffer contents implicitly scale to fit the presentation target size; that is, you can't turn off scaling.Notes for Metro style appsIf a Metro style app calls CreateSwapChain with full screen specified, CreateSwapChain fails.Metro style apps call the  IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForImmersiveWindow method to create a swap chain.

      <summary>	
            Resource data formats which includes fully-typed and typeless formats. There is a list of format modifiers at the bottom of the page,  that more fully describes each format type.	
            </summary>
      <remarks>	
            A few formats have additional restrictions.A resource declared with the DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32 family of formats cannot be used simultaneously for vertex and texture data. That is, you may not create a buffer resource with the DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32 family of formats that uses any of the following bind flags: <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.BindFlags.VertexBuffer" />, <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.BindFlags.IndexBuffer" />, <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.BindFlags.ConstantBuffer" />, or <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.BindFlags.StreamOutput" /> (see <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.BindFlags" />). <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R1_UNorm" /> is designed specifically for text filtering, and must be used with a format-specific, configurable 8x8 filter mode. When calling an HLSL sampling function using this format, the address offset parameter must be set to (0,0). A resource using a sub-sampled format (such as DXGI_FORMAT_R8G8_B8G8) must have a size that is a multiple of 2 in the x dimension. Format is not available in Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 10.1The following topics provide lists of the formats that particular hardware feature levels support:Hardware Support for Direct3D 11.1 Formats   Hardware Support for Direct3D 11 Formats   Hardware Support for Direct3D 10.1 Formats   Hardware Support for Direct3D 10 Formats   Hardware Support for Direct3D 10Level9 FormatsFor a list of the DirectXMath types that map to <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Format" /> values, see DirectXMath Library Internals.Format ModifiersEach enumeration value contains a format modifier which describes the data type.Format ModifiersDescription _FLOATA floating-point value; 32-bit floating-point formats use IEEE 754 single-precision (s23e8 format): sign bit, 8-bit biased (127) exponent,  and 23-bit mantissa. 16-bit floating-point formats use half-precision (s10e5 format): sign bit, 5-bit biased (15) exponent, and 10-bit mantissa. _SINTTwo's complement signed integer. For example, a 3-bit SINT represents the values -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. _SNORMSigned normalized integer; which is interpreted in a resource as a signed integer, and is interpreted in a shader as a signed normalized floating-point value in the range [-1, 1]. For an 2's complement number, the maximum value is 1.0f (a 5-bit value 01111 maps to 1.0f), and the minimum value is -1.0f (a 5-bit value 10000 maps to -1.0f). In addition, the second-minimum number maps to -1.0f (a 5-bit value 10001 maps to -1.0f). The resulting integer representations are evenly spaced floating-point values in the range (-1.0f...0.0f), and also a complementary set of representations for numbers in the range (0.0f...1.0f). _SRGBStandard RGB data, which roughly displays colors in a linear ramp of luminosity levels such that an average observer, under average viewing conditions, can view them on an average display.  <para>All 0's maps to 0.0f, and all 1's maps to 1.0f. The sequence of unsigned integer encodings between all 0's and all 1's represent a nonlinear progression in the floating-point interpretation of the numbers between 0.0f to 1.0f. For more detail, see the SRGB color standard, IEC 61996-2-1, at IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission).</para>	
             Conversion to or from sRGB space is automatically done by D3DX10 or D3DX9 texture-load functions. If the format has an alpha channel, the alpha data is also stored in sRGB color space.  _TYPELESSTypeless data, with a defined number of bits. Typeless formats are designed for creating typeless resources; that is, a resource whose size is known, but whose data type is not yet fully defined. When a typeless resource is bound to a shader, the application or shader must resolve the format type (which must match the number of bits per component in the typeless format). <para>A typeless format contains one or more subformats; each subformat resolves the data type. For example, in the R32G32B32 group, which defines types for three-component 96-bit data, there is one typeless format and three fully typed subformats.</para><code><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_Typeless" />, <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_Float" />, <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_UInt" />, <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_SInt" />,	
            	
            </code>	
               _UINTUnsigned integer. For instance, a 3-bit UINT represents the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. _UNORMUnsigned normalized integer; which is interpreted in a resource as an unsigned integer, and is interpreted in a shader as an unsigned normalized floating-point value in the range [0, 1]. All 0's maps to 0.0f, and all 1's maps to 1.0f. A sequence of evenly spaced floating-point values from 0.0f to 1.0f are represented. For instance, a 2-bit UNORM represents 0.0f, 1/3, 2/3, and 1.0f.?New Resource FormatsDirect3D 10 offers new data compression formats for compressing high-dynamic range (HDR) lighting data, normal maps and heightfields to a fraction of their original size. These compression types include:Shared-Exponent high-dynamic range (HDR) format (RGBE) New Block-Compressed 1-2 channel UNORM/SNORM formatsThe block compression formats can be used for any of the 2D or 3D texture types ( Texture2D, Texture2DArray, Texture3D, or TextureCube) including mipmap surfaces. The block compression techniques require texture dimensions to be a multiple of 4 (since the implementation compresses on blocks of 4x4 texels). In the texture sampler, compressed formats are always decompressed before texture filtering.

That is, presented content is not accessible by remote access or through the desktop duplication APIs.Swap chains that you create with the IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForHwnd, IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForImmersiveWindow, and  IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForCompositionSurface methods are not protected if DXGI_SWAP_CHAIN_FLAG_DISPLAY_ONLY is not set and are protected if DXGI_SWAP_CHAIN_FLAG_DISPLAY_ONLY is set. When swap chains are protected, screen scraping is prevented and, in full-screen mode, presented content is not accessible through the desktop duplication APIs.

            Options for handling pixels in a display surface after calling <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.Present(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags)" />.	
            </summary>
      <remarks>	
            This enumeration is used by the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription" /> structure.This enumeration is also used by the  DXGI_SWAP_CHAIN_DESC1 structure.The primary difference between presentation models is how back-buffer contents get to the Desktop Window Manager (DWM) for composition. In the bitblt model, which is used with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect.Discard" /> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect.Sequential" /> values, contents of the back buffer get copied into the redirection surface on each call to <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.Present(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags)" />. In the flip model, which is used with the DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_FLIP_SEQUENTIAL value, all back buffers are shared with the DWM. Therefore, the DWM can compose straight from those back buffers without any additional copy operations.	
            In general, the flip model is the more efficient model. The flip model also provides more features, such as enhanced present statistics.Regardless of whether the flip model is more efficient, an application still might choose the bitblt model for the following reasons:<para>The bitblt model is the only way to mix GDI and DirectX presentation.</para><para>In the flip model, the application must create the swap chain with <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFlags.GdiCompatible" />, and then must use GetDC on the back buffer explicitly. After the first successful call to <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.Present(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags)" /> on a flip-model swap chain, GDI no longer works with the <see cref="T:System.IntPtr" /> that is associated with that swap chain, even after the destruction of the swap chain. This restriction even extends to methods like ScrollWindowEx.</para>	
              The flip model requires at least three window-sized buffers if the application uses child windows. For the bitblt model, this minimum is two buffers.

Therefore, you should explicitly check for these constants. If you only use the SUCCEEDED macro on the return value to determine if  AcquireSync succeeded, you will not catch these constants.WAIT_ABANDONED - The shared surface and keyed mutex are no longer in a consistent state.

WAIT_TIMEOUT - The time-out interval elapsed before the specified key was released.</returns>
      <remarks>	
            The AcquireSync method creates a lock to a surface that is shared between multiple devices, allowing only one device to render to a surface at a time.   This method uses a key to determine which device currently has exclusive access to the surface.When a surface is created using the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.ResourceOptionFlags.SharedKeyedmutex" /> value of the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.ResourceOptionFlags" /> enumeration,  you must call the AcquireSync method before rendering to the surface.  You must call the ReleaseSync method when you are done  rendering to a surface.To acquire a reference to the keyed mutex object of a shared resource, call the QueryInterface method of the resource and pass in  the UUID of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.KeyedMutex" /> interface.  For more information about acquiring this reference, see the following code example.The AcquireSync method uses the key as follows, depending on the state of the surface:On initial creation, the surface is unowned and any device can call the AcquireSync method to gain access.  For an unowned device, only a key of 0 will succeed. Calling the AcquireSync method for any other key will stall the  calling CPU thread. If the surface is owned by a device when you call the AcquireSync method, the CPU thread that called  the AcquireSync method will stall until the owning device calls the ReleaseSync method  using the same Key. If the surface is unowned when you call the AcquireSync method (for example, the last owning device has already called  the ReleaseSync method), the AcquireSync method will succeed if you specify the same key  that was specified when the ReleaseSync method was last called. Calling the AcquireSync method using  any other key will cause a stall. When the owning device calls the ReleaseSync method with a particular key, and more than one device is waiting after  calling the  AcquireSync method using the same key, any one of the waiting devices could be woken up first.  The order in which devices are woken up is undefined. A keyed mutex does not support recursive calls to the AcquireSync method.

This is true regardless of target monitor rotation. A destination surface created by a graphics component (such as Direct3D 10) must be created with CPU-write permission (see <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.CpuAccessFlags.Write" />). Other surfaces should be created with CPU read-write permission (see D3D10_CPU_ACCESS_READ_WRITE).

            </summary>
      <remarks>	
            Direct3D devices require UNORM formats. This method finds the closest matching available display mode to the mode specified in pModeToMatch. Similarly ranked fields (ie. all specified, or all unspecified, etc) are resolved in the following order.  ScanlineOrdering Scaling Format Resolution RefreshRate  When determining the closest value for a particular field, previously matched fields are used to filter the display mode list choices, and  other fields are ignored. For example, when matching Resolution, the display mode list will have already been filtered by a certain ScanlineOrdering,  Scaling, and Format, while RefreshRate is ignored. This ordering doesn't define the absolute ordering for every usage scenario of FindClosestMatchingMode, because  the application can choose some values initially, effectively changing the order that fields are chosen. Fields of the display mode are matched one at a time, generally in a specified order. If a field is unspecified, FindClosestMatchingMode gravitates toward the values for the desktop related to this output.  If this output is not part of the desktop, then the default desktop output is used to find values. If an application uses a fully unspecified  display mode, FindClosestMatchingMode will typically return a display mode that matches the desktop settings for this output.   Unspecified fields are lower priority than specified fields and will be resolved later than specified fields.

      <remarks>	
            This method is not supported by DXGI 1.0, which shipped in Windows?Vista and Windows Server?2008. DXGI 1.1 support is required, which is available on  Windows?7, Windows Server?2008?R2, and as an update to Windows?Vista with Service Pack?2 (SP2) (KB 971644) and Windows Server?2008 (KB 971512).After you use the GetDC method to retrieve a DC, you can render to the DXGI surface by using GDI.   The GetDC method readies the surface for GDI rendering and allows inter-operation between DXGI and GDI technologies.Keep the following in mind when using this method:You must create the surface by using the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.GdiCompatible" /> flag for a surface or by using the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFlags.GdiCompatible" /> flag for swap chains,  otherwise this method fails. You must release the device and call the <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface1.ReleaseDC_(System.Nullable{SharpDX.Rectangle})" /> method before you issue any new Direct3D commands. This method fails if an outstanding DC has already been created by this method. The format for the surface or swap chain must be <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm_SRgb" /> or <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm" />. On GetDC, the render target in the output merger of the Direct3D pipeline is unbound from the surface.   You must call the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.OutputMergerStage.SetRenderTargets" /> method on the device prior to Direct3D rendering after GDI rendering. Prior to resizing buffers you must release all outstanding DCs.You can also call GetDC on the back buffer at index 0 of a swap chain by obtaining an <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface1" /> from the swap chain.   The following code illustrates the process.<code><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain" />* g_pSwapChain = <c>null</c>;	
            <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface1" />* g_pSurface1 = <c>null</c>;	
            ...	
            //Setup the device and and swapchain	
            g_pSwapChain-&gt;GetBuffer(0, __uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface1" />), (void**) &amp;g_pSurface1);

            ...      	
            //Draw on the DC using GDI	
            ...	
            //When finish drawing release the DC	
            g_pSurface1-&gt;ReleaseDC( <c>null</c> );

      <remarks>	
            DXGI may change the display state of a swap chain in response to end user or system requests.We recommend that you create a windowed swap chain and allow the end user to change the swap chain to full screen through SetFullscreenState; that is, do not set the Windowed member of <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription" /> to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False" /> to force the swap chain to be full screen. However, if you create the swap chain as full screen, also provide the end user with a list of supported display modes because a swap chain that is created with an unsupported display mode might cause the display to go black and prevent the end user from seeing anything. Also, we recommend that you have a time-out confirmation screen or other fallback mechanism when you allow the end user to change display modes.Notes for Metro style appsIf a Metro style app calls SetFullscreenState to set the display state to full screen, SetFullscreenState fails with <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.DXGIError.NotCurrentlyAvailable" />.You cannot call SetFullscreenState on a windowless swap chain that you created with IDXGIFactory2::CreateSwapChainForCompositionSurface.For the flip presentation model, after you transition the display state to full screen, you must call ResizeBuffers to ensure that your call to IDXGISwapChain1::Present1 succeeds.

      <remarks>	
            You can't resize a swap chain unless you release all outstanding references to its back buffers. You must release all of its direct and indirect references on the back buffers in order for ResizeBuffers to succeed.Direct references are held by the application after it calls AddRef on a resource.Indirect references are held by views to a resource, binding a view of the resource to a device context,  a command list that used the resource, a command list that used a view to that resource, a command list that executed another command list that used the  resource, and so on.Before you call ResizeBuffers, ensure that the application releases all references (by calling the appropriate number of Release invocations)  on the resources, any views to the resource, and any command lists that use either the resources or views, and ensure that neither the resource nor a view is  still bound to a device context.  You can use <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.ClearState" /> to ensure that all references are released. If a view is bound to a deferred context, you must discard the partially built command list as well (by calling ClearState, <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.FinishCommandListInternal" />, then Release on the command list).   After you call ResizeBuffers, you can re-query interfaces via <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.GetBuffer(System.Int32,System.Guid,System.IntPtr@)" />.For swap chains that you created with <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFlags.GdiCompatible" />, before you call ResizeBuffers, also call <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface1.ReleaseDC_(System.Nullable{SharpDX.Rectangle})" /> on the swap chain's back-buffer surface to ensure that you have no outstanding GDI device contexts (DCs) open.We recommend that you call ResizeBuffers when a client window is resized (that is, when an application receives a WM_SIZE message).The only difference between ResizeBuffers in Windows Developer Preview and ResizeBuffers in Windows?7 is with flip presentation model swap chains that you create with the DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_FLIP_SEQUENTIAL value set. In Windows Developer Preview, you must call ResizeBuffers to realize a transition between full-screen mode and windowed mode; otherwise, your next call to the Present method fails.

      <remarks>	
            If you attempt to create a swap chain in full-screen mode, and full-screen mode is unavailable, the swap chain will be created in windowed mode and DXGI_STATUS_OCCLUDED will be returned. If the buffer width or the buffer height are zero, the sizes will be inferred from the output window size in the swap-chain description. Since the target output cannot be chosen explicitly when the swap-chain is created, you should not create a full-screen swap chain. This can reduce presentation performance if the swap chain size and the output window size do not match. Here are two ways to ensure the sizes match:  Create a windowed swap chain and then set it full-screen using <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.SetFullscreenState(System.Boolean,SharpDX.DXGI.Output)" />. Save a reference to the swap-chain immediately after creation, and use it to get the output window size during a WM_SIZE event. Then resize the swap chain buffers (with <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.ResizeBuffers(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.Format,System.Int32)" />) during the transition from windowed to full-screen.  If the swap chain is in full-screen mode, before you release it, you must use {{SetFullscreenState}} to switch it to windowed mode. For more information about releasing a swap chain, see the Destroying a Swap Chain section of {{DXGI Overview}}.

You set the DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_FLIP_SEQUENTIAL value in the SwapEffect member of the DXGI_SWAP_CHAIN_DESC1 structure to specify that the swap chain uses the flip presentation model.The values in the PresentCount and PresentRefreshCount members indicate information about when a frame was presented on the display screen. You can use these values to determine whether a glitch occurred. The values in the SyncRefreshCount and SyncQPCTime members indicate timing information that you can use for audio and video synchronization or very precise animation. If the swap chain draws in full-screen mode, these values are based on when the computer booted. 	
            If the swap chain draws in windowed mode, these values are based on when the swap chain is created.
