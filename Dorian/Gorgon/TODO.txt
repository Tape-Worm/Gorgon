This list is not in order.  Please don't get excited.

* Refactor the texture class into a better abstract class using D3DResources (Done)
	+ Put in updatesubresource functionality for textures (Done)
	+ Put in map functionality for textures	(Done)
	+ Add GetSubResourceIndex1/2/3D to the Textures interface (Done, added to texture objects as static member).
* Add buffers
	+ Update vertex buffer (and index buffer?  Need to research) code to allow for stream output from Geometry shaders.
	+ Add raw buffers 
	+ Add structured buffer (Done)
		- Add append and counter buffers (Done)
	+ Add type buffer
	+ Add argument buffer (for DrawIndirect)
* Finish shader objects in base graphics library.
	+ Add ability to load/save shaders from text file and compiled form. (Done)
	+ Maybe consider putting in shader reflection.
	+ Add compute, domain, hull and geometry shaders.
	+ Add #include support - This is necessary especially when pulling stuff from a virtual file system. (Done)
	+ A lightweight effects framework to simplify shaders. (Done)
	+ Some basic shaders for blurring, color inversion, sharpening, etc... (Done)
		- Expose these as 'Effect' objects for easier use. (Done)
	+ Add functionality to allow creation of custom shader resource/unordered views for objects.
* Add multi-threaded support for D3D 11 device contexts.
* Maybe update Gorgon2D to create a swap chain in its Create2DRenderer method in addition to passing one in. (Done)
* Update 2D shader code (Not necessary, 2D specific shader types are now gone and integrated via #GorgonInclude in the shader).
* Add bounding box/circle for renderable objects. (Done)
* Add font management code.
	+ Code for generating (for use in the editor, but will be public) (Done).	
	+ Loading/saving bitmap fonts. (Done)
* Add text output code.
	+ Add text sprite.  (Done)
	+ Add alignment (Done)
	+ Add word wrap (Done)
	+ Add shadowing (Done)
	+ Add global "DrawText" to Drawing property. (Done)
* Add horizontal/vertical flip to sprites. (Done)
* Add animation to renderable objects. (Done)
* Add more primitives:
	+ Line polygon
	+ Filled polygon (may need to be a separate object because it works quite differently).
* Add a batch renderable using a static vertex buffer (possible with dynamic, may be worth looking into)
* Add perspective camera
* Add perspective sprites
* Add user definable shaders for 2D library. (Done)
* Write editor for creating/editing sprites, fonts, shaders (maybe), textures (maybe, probably not)
	+ This time make it one large program that uses a project so everything can be integrated.
	+ Maybe allow for pack file support like zip, previous gorgon bzip stuff.
* Consider dropping feature level 9 support, it's really painful and limits what we can do.
* Maybe add higher level code for GUI, scenegraph, collisions, etc... once base library is working and relatively bug free
* Way in the future... maybe write a 3D component for Gorgon.  A lot of work though, very lazy.
