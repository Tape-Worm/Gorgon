This list is not in order.  Please don't get excited.

* Refactor the texture class into a better abstract class using D3DResources (Done)
	+ Put in updatesubresource functionality for textures (Done)
	+ Put in map functionality for textures	(Done)
	+ Add GetSubResourceIndex1/2/3D to the Textures interface (Done, added to texture objects as static member).
* Add buffers
	+ Basic GPU/CPU buffer (this would allow for structured buffers to be sent to the shader).
	+ Update vertex buffer (and index buffer?  Need to research) code to allow for stream output from Geometry shaders.
	+ Need better understanding of how textures map to structured buffers and other shader types.	
* Finish shader objects in base graphics library.
	+ Add ability to load/save shaders from text file and compiled form.
	+ Maybe consider putting in shader reflection.
	+ Add compute, domain, hull and geometry shaders (do this ASAP)
	+ Add #include support - This is necessary especially when pulling stuff from a virtual file system.
* Add multi-threaded support for D3D 11 device contexts.
* Maybe update Gorgon2D to create a swap chain in its Create2DRenderer method in addition to passing one in.
* Update 2D shader code
	+ Load/Save binary/text formats.
	+ Parse and put in Gorgon 2D specific shader code with required instruction.
* Add font management code.
	+ Add code for generating and loading/saving bitmap fonts (for use in the editor, but will be public).
* Add text output code.
* Add horizontal/vertical flip to sprites.
* Add animation to renderable objects.
* Add more primitives:
	+ Line polygon
	+ Filled polygon (may need to be a separate object because it works quite differently).
* Add a batch renderable using a static vertex buffer (possible with dynamic, may be worth looking into)
* Add perspective camera
* Add perspective sprites
* Add user definable shaders for 2D library.
* Write editor for creating/editing sprites, fonts, shaders (maybe), textures (maybe)
	+ This time make it one large program that uses a project so everything can be integrated.
	+ Maybe allow for pack file support like zip, previous gorgon bzip stuff.
* Consider dropping feature level 9 support, it's really painful and limits what we can do.
* Maybe add higher level code for GUI, scenegraph, collisions, etc... once base library is working and relatively bug free
* Way in the future... maybe write a 3D component for Gorgon.  A lot of work though, very lazy.
