	/// <remarks>
	/// Gorgon is capable of making use of Virtual File Systems.  This is quite different from the file system type that was in the
	/// first version of Gorgon which was really nothing more than a compressed file reader/writer (even though it could mount 
	/// folders).
	/// 
	/// Virtual File Systems take a directory, or some packed data file and mount it as a root directory.  Any subsequent directories
	/// and files inside of the directory (or file) are mapped to be relative to the root point on the file system.  For example,
	/// mounting the D:\DataDirectory\ path as a VFS will make the path D:\DataDirectory\SubDirectory map to /SubDirectory in the
	/// virtual file system.  This has to advantage of making it so your application can't go higher than the directory (or file) 
	/// that was mounted as the root of the VFS.  This allows for a certain level of security to keep users from writing or reading
	/// areas outside of the intended directory structure.  
	/// 
	/// Gorgon's VFS is modeled after the PhysFS project (http://icculus.org/physfs/).
	/// 
	/// The VFS object in Gorgon comes with the ability to mount a directory as a root of a VFS.  However, it's possible to mount a
	/// zip file, or the old Gorgon BZip2 Pack file format as a VFS.  This is done through file system providers.  Similar to the
	/// input factories, these providers are plug-ins and can be loaded into a file system object to give access to these types of 
	/// files.  A provider plug-in can be written to pull data from a SQL server, or a network stream or any access point that can
	/// stream data.
	/// 
	/// In this example, we'll show how to load some of these providers.
