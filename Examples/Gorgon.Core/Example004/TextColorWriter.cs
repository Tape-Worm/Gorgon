	/// We could have just as easily used an interface here, but an abstract class will work for our needs.
	/// 
	/// As you can see, it's just a basic abstract class, there's no plug-in details anywhere and there isn't any need for it
	/// because all of the plug-in specific information is stored in the actual plug-in assembly DLL.  This way, we could implement
	/// this class in our application for default behaviour, and override that behaviour in our plug-in class.
