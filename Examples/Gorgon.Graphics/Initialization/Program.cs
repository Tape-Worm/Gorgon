	/// <summary>
	/// This is an example of using the core graphics API.  
	/// 
	/// It will show how to create and initialize the graphics API.  We do this by creating a GorgonGraphics object and a 
	/// GorgonSwapChain object that is used to display graphical data.
	/// 
	/// GorgonGraphics
	/// ===========================================================================================================================
	/// 
	/// This is the primary object used to send data to the GPU. This object can be used to define which video device can be used 
	/// for rendering, and multiple GorgonGraphics objects can allow an application to use multiple video devices at once time
	/// (note: This is not the same as multiple head outputs on a video device).
	/// 
	/// Graphics objects created with Gorgon must pass in an instance of the GorgonGraphics object for the specific video device 
	/// when creating them. This associates the data created by these objects to the video device used for rendering.
	/// 
	/// The GorgonGraphics object can also be used to force a specific feature level for a video device. This allows Gorgon to 
	/// be compatible with a wide range of video devices that don't support Direct3D 11.1 (at this point, this option is kind of 
	/// moot as the vast majority of video devices these days are more than capable of D3D 11.1). If the feature level is not 
	/// defined, then the maximum feature level supported by the device is used.
	/// 
	/// To initialize the GorgonGraphics object, an application needs to pass in an IGorgonVideoDeviceInfo object associated 
	/// with the desired video device. This will be retrieved from the IGorgonVideoDeviceList object which is merely a collection 
	/// of available video devices installed on the computer. 
	/// 
	/// Since this example does not focus on rendering data, this object is merely used to get things going. 
	/// 
	/// GorgonSwapChain
	/// ===========================================================================================================================
	/// 
	/// A swap chain allows us to send our graphics data to the screen.  We can create multiple swap chains and even make them all 
	/// full screen (provided they are different monitors).
	///
	/// A GorgonSwapChain requries an IGorgonSwapChainInfo object that will contain the swap chain settings required for initializing 
	/// a swap chain. Because a swap chain uses multiple buffers to present graphical data to the screen, a buffer size is required 
	/// and is typically set to the same size as the client area on the window that will be bound to the swap chain.  This buffer 
	/// size will resized when the window is resized, or can be resized manually through a method on the object. 
	/// 
	/// Swap chains can also enter/exit full screen exclusive mode, but for our purposes here we won't be doing that.
	/// 
	/// For this example we're just going to assign a window (although this could be any type that inherits from 
	/// System.Windows.Forms.Control) to the swap chain via its constructor, and set its initial size to the client size of the 
	/// window. 
	/// 
	/// When setting up a swap chain, it is important to know which buffer format to use for the back buffers.  To this end, the 
	/// GorgonGraphics.VideoDevice has a method called GetBufferFormatSupport that will indicate which formats are valid for use as 
	/// a swap chain format. Well behaved applications should check with this method prior to setting up the swap chain.
	/// 
	/// Finally, to see something on the screen an application needs to call the Present method on the swap chain. This flips the 
	/// current backbuffer frame to the window and can have a presentation interval to lock down the presentation to the refresh 
	/// rate for the current video mode (this does not apply to windowed mode, and as such is not necessary for this application).
