    /// <summary>
    /// This example focuses on Gorgon's Image library.
    /// 
    /// The image library is meant to hold 1D, 2D and 3D image data in memory. It is laid out much like a Direct 3D texture in that it supports image arrays, 
    /// mip maps, image cubes and depth images.  It also supports many different image pixel layout formats like R8, R8G8B8A8_*, etc... 
    /// 
    /// The image manipulation functionality is built on a fluent interface, so that you can chain operations together like this:
    /// image.Resize(160, 100, 1).Crop(new SharpDX.Rectangle(120, 80, 40, 40), 1)
    /// 
    /// Users can create their own image and modify the image data directly (provided they know the format of data in the image) by manipulating the buffers 
    /// of the image. These buffers are indexed by mip level, and array (or depth) level, and have their own size (in the case of mip maps). By accessing the 
    /// Data property (which is a GorgonNativeBuffer), users can manipulate image data at a byte level.
    /// 
    /// Gorgon also supports image codecs that load, and save image data.  It supports 6 formats out of the box:
    /// Windows Bitmap (bmp)
    /// Portable Network Graphics (png)
    /// Joint Photographers Experts Group (jpeg)
    /// Targa (tga)
    /// Direct Draw Surface (dds)
    /// Graphics Interface Format (gif) - This one supports animation.
    /// 
    /// Users can also add their own codecs by using the GorgonImageCodecPlugin.  However, this is outside of the scope for this example and is demonstrated 
    /// in the TvImageCodec example.
    /// 
    /// This example also includes code to show how to load and animate an animated GIF using a background task.
    /// 
    /// The ImageGallery and GifAnimator classes contain the relevant code for this example.
    /// </summary>
