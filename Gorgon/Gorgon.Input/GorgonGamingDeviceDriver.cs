	/// <summary>
	/// The required functionality for a gaming device driver.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>
	/// A gaming device driver provides access to various gaming input devices like a joystick, game pad, etc... This allows for various input providers to be used when accessing these devices. For example, 
	/// Gorgon comes with 2 drivers: One for XBOX controllers (via XInput), and one for generic joysticks/game pads (via Direct Input).
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// <note type="important">
	/// The XInput driver does not enumerate or use any other type of controllers other than XBox controllers, and the Direct Input driver purposely ignores XBox controllers so that only generic devices 
	/// get enumerated. This is done because the XInput controller provides more features for the XBox controllers, and the mapping of the device interface (i.e. axes, POV, etc...) is not as straight 
	/// forward.
	/// </note>
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// These drivers are typically loaded as plug ins from  a <see cref="IGorgonGamingDeviceDriverFactory"/>. The driver is responsible for enumerating the available devices that it supports, and will 
	/// create instances of a <see cref="IGorgonGamingDevice"/> that represents the functionality of the gaming device as provided by the underlying native provider. 
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Because drivers may need to set up native resources for internal use, this interface implements <see cref="IDisposable"/>, and in order to avoid leakage of resource data, the <see cref="IDisposable.Dispose"/> 
	/// method <b>must</b> be called when done with the driver.
	/// </para>
	/// </remarks>
	/// <example>
	/// <see cref="GorgonPluginAssemblyCache.Load(string)"/>
	/// The following shows how to load a <see cref="IGorgonGamingDeviceDriver"/> and enumerate the devices:
	/// <code language="csharp">
	/// <![CDATA[
	/// IReadOnlyList<GorgonGamingDeviceInfo> joysticks = null;
	/// 
	/// using (var assemblies = new GorgonPluginAssemblyCache())
	/// {
	///		var plugInService = new GorgonPluginService(assemblies);
	///		var factory = new GorgonGamingDeviceDriverFactory(plugInService);
	///
	///		// Load the assembly for the XInput driver.
	///		assemblies.Load(".\Gorgon.Input.XInput.dll");
	/// 
	///		// Get the correct driver from the plug ins via the factory. 
	///		IGorgonGamingDeviceDriver driver = factory.Load("Gorgon.Input.GorgonXInputDriver");
	/// 
	///		// Get connected devices only. You may change the parameter to false to retrieve all devices.
	///		joysticks = driver.EnumerateGamingDevices(true);
	/// 
	///		foreach(IGorgonGamingDeviceInfo info in joysticks)
	///		{
	///			Console.WriteLine("Controller: {0}", info.Description);
	///		}
	/// } 
	/// ]]>
