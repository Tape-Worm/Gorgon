	/// Gaming devices (such as a joystick or game pad) and provided via a driver system using the <see cref="GorgonGamingDeviceDriver"/> object. These drivers may be loaded via a plug in interface through the 
	/// <see cref="GorgonGamingDeviceDriverFactory"/> object. Once a driver is loaded, it can be used to create an object of this type.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// The gaming devices can support a variable number of axes, and this is reflected within the <see cref="Axis"/> property to make available only those axes which are supported by the device. For example, 
	/// if the device supports a single horizontal axis and that axis is mapped to the secondary axis (<see cref="GamingDeviceAxis.XAxis2"/>), then the <see cref="Axis"/> collection will only contain a member 
	/// for the <see cref="GamingDeviceAxis.XAxis2"/> value.  Likewise, if it supports many axes, then all of those axes will be made available. To determine which axes are supported, use the <see cref="GorgonGamingDeviceAxisList{T}.Contains"/>
	/// method on the <see cref="Info"/>.<see cref="IGorgonGamingDeviceInfo.AxisInfo"/> property or the on the <see cref="Axis"/> property.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// <see cref="GorgonGamingDevice"/> objects require that the device be polled via a call to the <see cref="Poll"/> method. This will capture the latest state from the physical device and store it within 
	/// this type for use by an application.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Some gaming devices (such as XInput controllers) offer special functionality like vibration. This object supports sending data to the physical device to activate the special functionality. If the device 
	/// does not support the functionality, an exception is typically thrown. Use the <see cref="IGorgonGamingDeviceInfo.Capabilities"/> property to determine if these special functions are supported by the 
	/// device before calling.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Implementors of a <see cref="GorgonGamingDeviceDriver"/> plug in must inherit this type in order to expose functionality from a native provider (e.g. XInput).
