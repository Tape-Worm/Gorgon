	/// A writer that will lay out and write the contents of a <conceptualLink target="7b81343e-e2fc-4f0f-926a-d9193ae481fe">Gorgon Chunk File Format (GCFF)</conceptualLink> file.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>
	/// This allows access to a file format that uses the concept of grouping sections of an object together into a grouping called a chunk. This chunk will hold binary data associated with an object allows 
	/// the developer to read/write only the pieces of the object that are absolutely necessary while skipping optional chunks.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// A more detailed explanation of the chunk file format can be found in the <conceptualLink target="7b81343e-e2fc-4f0f-926a-d9193ae481fe">Gorgon Chunk File Format (GCFF)</conceptualLink> topic.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// A chunk file object will expose a collection of <see cref="GorgonChunk"/> values, and these give the available chunks in the file and can be looked up either by the <see cref="ulong"/> value for 
	/// the chunk ID, or an 8 character <see cref="string"/> that represents the chunk (this is recommended for readability). This allows an application to do validation on the chunk file to ensure that 
	/// its format is correct. It also allows an application to discard chunks it doesn't care about or are optional. This allows for some level of versioning between chunk file formats.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Chunks can be accessed in any order, not just the order in which they were written. This allows an application to only take the pieces they require from the file, and leave the rest. It also allows 
	/// for optional chunks that can be skipped if not present, and read/written when they are.
	/// </para>

	/// Gorgon uses the chunked file format for its own file serializing/deserializing of its objects that support persistence.
