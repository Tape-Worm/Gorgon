	/// <summary>
	/// An application class for windows <see cref="Form"/> applications.
	/// </summary> 
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>
	/// This class is meant as a replacement for the standard windows forms <see cref="Application"/> class. It expands the functionality of the application class by exposing useful functionality for 
	/// working with the main application <see cref="Form"/>.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// One of the key components to this class is the introduction of a proper Idle loop. This allows an application to perform operations while the windows message pump is in an idle state. This is useful 
	/// for things like games, or applications that require constant interaction with other systems. To set an idle loop you may pass a method to execute in one of the <see cref="O:Gorgon.UI.GorgonApplication.Run">Run</see> 
	/// overloads. Or, if you choose, you may assign an idle method to execute at any point in the application life cycle by assigning a method to the <see cref="IdleMethod"/>.
	/// </para> 
	/// <para>
	/// Like the <see cref="Application"/> class, this class also provides the ability to pass a windows <see cref="Form"/>, or <see cref="ApplicationContext"/> to one of the <see cref="O:Gorgon.UI.GorgonApplication.Run">Run</see> 
	/// overloads. 
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// <note type="tip">
	/// <para>
	/// When passing a form to the <see cref="Run(System.Windows.Forms.Form,System.Func{bool})"/> method, that form automatically becomes the main application window. The application will exit when this form is closed. 
	/// The main form of an application may be retrieved from the <see cref="MainForm"/> property. 
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// If this is not suitable, one of the other <see cref="O:Gorgon.UI.GorgonApplication.Run">Run</see> overloads will allow you to finely control the life cycle of your application.
	/// </para>
	/// </note>
	/// </para>
	/// </remarks>
	/// <example>
	/// An application that wishes to use this class instead of the <see cref="Application"/> class should follow this pattern:
	/// <code language="csharp">
	/// <![CDATA[
	/// // In program.cs:
	/// [STAThread]
	///	static void Main()
	///	{
	///		try
	///		{
	///			Application.EnableVisualStyles();
	///			Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
	///
	///			// Perhaps you could run initialization stuff here.			
	///
	///			// This replaces:
	///			// Application.Run(new YourMainForm());
	///			
	///			// This will run with a form and an idle method named "Idle"
	///			GorgonApplication.Run(new YourMainForm(), Idle);
	///		}
	///		catch (Exception ex)
	///		{
	///			// You should always catch any unhandled exceptions and either log them, or display them, or something.
	///			// It can get real ugly for your users otherwise.
	///			ex.Catch(_ => GorgonDialogs.ErrorBox(null, _), GorgonApplication.Log);
	///		}
