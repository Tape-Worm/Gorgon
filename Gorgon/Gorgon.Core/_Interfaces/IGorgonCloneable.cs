	/// <remarks>
	/// The .NET framework provides us with a <see cref="ICloneable"/> interface for objects that can be cloned. However, it returns the cloned object as a <see cref="object"/> type. This can 
	/// introduce boxing issues for value types that implement <c>ICloneable</c>. This interface will allow us to mitigate the boxing issues by providing a strongly typed cloning interface.
