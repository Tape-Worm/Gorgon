	/// <summary>
	/// An implementation of the <see cref="IGorgonTimer"/> interface.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>
	/// This implementation uses the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd757629(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank">Windows Multimedia timer</a>. It fairly stable across all hardware and provides 
	/// measurement of time down to 1 millisecond. 
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// <h2>Issues</h2>
	/// There are a few caveats when using this timer:
	/// <list type="bullet">
	/// <item><description>This timer wraps around to 0 every 2^32 milliseconds (~49.71 days), and can cause issues in code relying on this type of timer. Gorgon will do its best to ensure this is not a problem.</description></item>
	/// <item><description> It has a default precision of 5 milliseconds, but Gorgon will attempt to change the resolution to 1 millisecond when using the <see cref="GorgonApplication"/> class.</description></item>
	/// </list>
	/// The second bullet point is important, since it will change the timer frequency not only for the application, but across the system. This may cause weird issues with other applications relying on this 
	/// timer. Also, since only the <see cref="GorgonApplication"/> class manages the period for the timer automatically, it'll be up to the user to set and reset the period frequency via the <see cref="BeginTiming"/> 
	/// and <see cref="EndTiming"/> static methods on this class if the <see cref="GorgonApplication"/> class is not used in your application. It is vitally important that the <see cref="EndTiming"/> method is called 
	/// when the <see cref="BeginTiming"/> method is used. Failure to do so can leave the operating system timing in a state where the task scheduler switches tasks more often and the power saving may not trigger 
	/// properly.
	/// </para>
