	/// <para>
	/// This represents the information for a file on a physical file system. This object only contains data about the file, and <u>not</u> the file itself. These files are read only and cannot be written

	/// <para>
	/// Users may retrieve a file from a <see cref="IGorgonFileSystem"/> via the <see cref="IGorgonFileSystem.GetFile"/> method. When the file has been returned to the user, they may call the <see cref="OpenStream"/> 
	/// method to read the contents of the file.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// To create, update or delete a file from the <see cref="IGorgonFileSystem"/>, use an instance of the <see cref="IGorgonFileSystemWriter{T}"/> object and call the <see cref="IGorgonFileSystemWriter{T}.OpenStream"/> 
	/// method to create or update a file. Use the <see cref="IGorgonFileSystemWriter{T}.DeleteFile"/> method to delete a file.
	/// </para>
	/// </remarks>
	/// <example>
	/// This is an example of retrieving a file, and opening it for reading:

	/// <![CDATA[
	/// IGorgonFileSystem fileSystem = new GorgonFileSystem();
