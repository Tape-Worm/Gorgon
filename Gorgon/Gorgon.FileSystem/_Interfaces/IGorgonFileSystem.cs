	/// <summary>
	/// The virtual file System interface.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>
	/// This will allow the user to mount directories or packed files (such as Zip files) into a unified file system.  For example, if the user has mounted MyData.zip and C:\users\Bob\Data\ into the file 
	/// system then all files and/or directories from both sources would be combined into a single virtual file system. This has the advantage of being able to access disparate file systems without having 
	/// to run through multiple interfaces to get at their data.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// The virtual file system is a read only file system. This is done by design so that the integrity of the original physical file systems can be preserved. If your application needs to write data into 
	/// the file system, then the <see cref="IGorgonFileSystemWriter{T}"/> has been provided to give access to a writable area that will integrate with this object.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Physical file systems (such as a windows directory or a Zip file) are "mounted" into this object. When a physical file system is mounted, all of the file names (and other info) and directory names 
	/// will be stored in hierarchal structure similar to a Unix directory structure. Because of this, there will be some differences from the typical Windows directory setup:
	/// <list type="bullet">
	/// <item>
	///		<description>The root of the file system is not "C:\" or "\\Computer\". In this object, the root is '/' (e.g. <c>/MyFile.txt</c> is a file located in the root).</description> 
	/// </item>
	/// <item>
	///		<description>The directory separators are forward slashes: / and not back slashes: \. (e.g. <c>c:\MyDirectory\MySubDirectory\</c> is now <c><![CDATA[/MyDirectory/MySubDirectory/]]></c>)</description>
	/// </item>
	/// </list>
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// <note type="important">
	/// <para>
	/// The order in which file systems are mounted into the virtual file system is important.  If a zip file contains SomeText.txt, and a directory contains the same file path, then if the zip file is 
	/// mounted, followed by the directory, the file in the directory will override the file in the zip file. This is true for directories as well. 
	/// </para>
	/// </note>
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// By default, a new file system instance will only have access to the directories and files of the hard drive via the default provider. File systems that are in packed files (e.g. Zip files) can be 
	/// loaded into the file system by way of a <see cref="GorgonFileSystemProvider"/>. Providers are typically plug in objects that are loaded into the file system via the <see cref="GorgonFileSystemProviderFactory"/>.  
	/// Once a provider plug in is loaded, then the contents of that file system can be mounted like a standard directory. 
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// When a file system provider is added to the virtual file system object upon creation, the object will contain 2 providers, the default provider is always available with any additional providers.
	/// </para>
	/// </remarks>
	/// <seealso cref="IGorgonFileSystemWriter{T}"/>
	/// <seealso cref="GorgonFileSystemProvider"/>
	/// <example>
	/// This example shows how to create a file system with the default provider, and mount a directory to the root:
	/// <code language="csharp">
	/// <![CDATA[
	/// IGorgonFileSystem fileSystem = new GorgonFileSystem();
	/// 
	/// fileSystem.Mount(@"C:\MyDirectory\", "/"); 
	/// ]]>
	/// </code>
	/// This example shows how to load a provider from the provider factory and use it with the file system:
	/// <code language="csharp">
	/// <![CDATA[
	/// // First we need to load the assembly with the provider plug in.
	/// using (GorgonPluginAssemblyCache assemblies = new GorgonPluginAssemblyCache())
	/// {
	///		assemblies.Load(@"C:\PlugIns\GorgonFileSystem.Zip.dll"); 
	///		GorgonPluginService plugInService = new GorgonPluginService(assemblies);
	/// 
	///		// We'll use the factory to get the zip plug in provider.
	///		IGorgonFileSystemProviderFactory factory = new GorgonFileSystemProviderFactory(plugInService);
	///		
	///		IGorgonFileSystemProvider zipProvider = factory.CreateProvider("Gorgon.IO.Zip.ZipProvider");
	/// 
	///		// Now create the file system with the zip provider.
	///		IGorgonFileSystem fileSystem = new GorgonFileSystem(zipProvider);
	///		fileSystem.Mount(@"C:\ZipFiles\MyFileSystem.zip", "/");
