	/// Users may retrieve a file from a <see cref="IGorgonFileSystem"/> via the <see cref="IGorgonFileSystem.GetFile"/> method. When the file has been returned to the user, they may call the <see cref="OpenStream"/> 
	/// method to read the contents of the file.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// To create, update or delete a file from the <see cref="IGorgonFileSystem"/>, use an instance of the <see cref="IGorgonFileSystemWriteArea{T}"/> object and call the <see cref="IGorgonFileSystemWriteArea{T}.OpenStream"/>
