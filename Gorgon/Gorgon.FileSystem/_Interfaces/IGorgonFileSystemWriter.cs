	/// <summary>
	/// Specifies a writable area on the physical file system for a virtual file system.
	/// </summary>
	/// <typeparam name="T">The type of stream returned from <see cref="OpenStream"/>.</typeparam>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>
	/// The <see cref="IGorgonFileSystem"/> is a read only object that is only capable of returning existing files and directories from a physical file system. This is by design in order to keep the integrity 
	/// and security of the original file system intact. However, in some cases, the need to write data is required by the application, and that data should be reflected in the current file system. Thus, we 
	/// have the <see cref="IGorgonFileSystemWriter{T}"/> interface.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// This object will allow applications to define an area on a physical file system that can be written to by the application. This provides isolation from the main file system and gives a degree of security 
	/// when persisting data to an application. For example, if you have a zip file mounted in <c>/</c> and you want to write some data in a new directory, then you could create this object and provide a 
	/// path to the writable area: <c>c:\users\username\AppData\YourApplication\CustomData\</c>. When creating, or deleting a directory or file, all data will be shunted to that physical location. For example, 
	/// creating a directory named <c>CustomDirectory</c> would actually put the directory under <c>c:\users\AppData\YourApplication\CustomData\CustomDirectory</c>. Likewise, a file named <c>SomeFile.txt</c> would 
	/// be put under <c>>c:\users\username\AppData\YourApplication\CustomData\SomeFile.txt</c>.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// If the <see cref="IGorgonFileSystem"/> already has a file or directory mounted from a physical file system, then files from the write area will override those files, providing the most up to date copy of 
	/// the data in the physical file systems. There is no actual change to the original files and they will remain in their original location, untouched. Only the files in the directory designated to be the writable 
	/// area for a file system will be used for write operations.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Because the type parameter <typeparamref name="T"/> is based on <see cref="Stream"/>, we can use this interface to build an object that can write into anything that supports a stream, including memory.
	/// </para>
	/// <para> 
	/// <note type="tip">
	/// <para>
	/// When attaching a <see cref="IGorgonFileSystemWriter{T}"/> to a <see cref="IGorgonFileSystem"/>, the write area location is <u>always</u> mounted to the root of the virtual file system.
	/// </para>
	/// </note> 
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// <note type="warning">
	/// <para>
	/// Because the <see cref="IGorgonFileSystem.Mount"/> method always overrides existing files and directories (with the same path) with files and directories from the last loaded physical file system, the write 
	/// area may have its files overridden if <see cref="IGorgonFileSystem.Mount"/> is called after linking the write area with a <see cref="IGorgonFileSystem"/>.
	/// </para>
	/// </note>
	/// </para>
	/// </remarks>
	/// <example>
	/// This example shows how to create a file system with the default provider, mount a directory to the root, and create a new file:
	/// <code language="csharp">
	/// <![CDATA[
	/// IGorgonFileSystem fileSystem = new GorgonFileSystem();
	/// IGorgonFileSystemWriter writeArea = new GorgonFileSystemWriter(fileSystem, @"C:\MyWritingSpot\");
	/// 
	/// // Mount a directory for this file system.
	/// fileSystem.Mount(@"C:\MyDirectory\", "/"); 
	/// 
	/// // Ensure that we mount the write area to ensure that the files in the write directory 
	/// // are available.
	/// writeArea.Mount();
	/// 
	/// // Create a text file.
	/// using (Stream stream = writeArea.OpenStream("/AFile.txt", FileMode.Create))
	/// {
	///		using (StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(stream, Encoding.UTF8))
	///		{
	///			writer.WriteLine("This is a line of text.");
	///		}
	/// }
	/// 
	/// // This should retrieve the updated file.
	/// IGorgonVirtualFile file = fileSystem.GetFile("/AFile.txt");
