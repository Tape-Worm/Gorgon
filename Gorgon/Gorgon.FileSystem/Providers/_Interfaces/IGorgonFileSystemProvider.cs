	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>
	/// File system providers provide access to a physical file system, and provides the communications necessary to read data from that physical file system. When used in conjunction with the <see cref="IGorgonFileSystem"/> 
	/// object, a provider enables access to multiple types of physical file systems so they seamlessly appear to be from a single file system. The underlying system has no idea if the file is a standard 
	/// file system file, or a file inside of a zip archive.  
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// <note type="important">
	/// <para>
	/// As the documentation states, providers can read data from a file system. However, no mechanism is available to write to a file system through a provider. This is by design. The <see cref="IGorgonFileSystemWriter{T}"/> 
	/// type allows writing to a file system via a predefined area in a physical file system. 
	/// </para>
	/// </note>
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// When this type is implemented, it can be made to read any type of file system, including those that store their contents in a packed file format (e.g. Zip). And since this type inherits from <see cref="GorgonPlugin"/>, 
	/// the file system provider can be loaded dynamically through Gorgon's plug in system.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Some providers may not use a physical location on the operating system file system. In such cases, implementors of a <see cref="IGorgonFileSystemProvider"/> must provide a prefix for a physical location 
	/// (e.g. <c>Mount("::\\Prefix\DirectoryName", "/");</c>, <c>Mount("::\\Prefix", "/")</c>, or whatever else the provider chooses). This prefix is specific to the provider and should be made available via 
	/// the <see cref="Prefix"/> property. The prefix must <u>always</u> begin with the characters <c>::\\</c>. Otherwise, the <see cref="IGorgonFileSystem"/> will not know how to parse the physical location.
